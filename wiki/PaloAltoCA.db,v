@type³wiki³backlinks³AugustOneHundredGrads ³logname³³text³Municipal code is here ( http://nt2.scbbs.com/cgi-bin/om_isapi.dll?clientID=228010&infobase=procode-3&jump=4.54&softpage=ref_Doc#JUMPDEST_4.54 ).  
Seems to indicate (hallelujah!) that you can get a Massage Technician permit if you have had completed at least 70 hours of instruction and received a certificate of completion.  Not sure about how they deal with outcall/freelancers.  Palo Alto has lots of little office spaces that are rentable, though, and that may be a good option for me!  Strata
