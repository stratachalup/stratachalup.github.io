type³wiki³backlinks³AugustOneHundredGrads ³logname³³text³While looking for used massage tables, I found this "Bodyworker
Bulletin Board" with postings looking for bodyworkers in CA.
Some good listings, and recent (late August).

Talked to the folks at Kivas (http://www.kivaretreat.com) in Santa Cruz.  They only audition people with 3 or 
more years of fulltime massage practice.  Oh well!  Still a beautiful place, and they have stationary massage
tables outside on the back deck.  If their massage therapists are practicing indoors, or there aren't many
massages happening, guests are allowed to use the tables to massage each other or just sunbathe.  I miss Kiro,
their big black SpaCat, but little Isis has taken over being aloof and graceful, so Kivas still has a feline presence.  Strata

Add more stuff here!  :-)
