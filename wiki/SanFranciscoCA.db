It seems to indicate that if you have 70 or more hours of instruction and a certificate from a school, you can get a permit to do outcall massage.  I'm still studying it.  Strata

Here are instructions about the permits.  The page here (http://www.ci.sf.ca.us/police/public/permits/permitsmnu.htm) includes a link 
to a PDF (Acrobat) version of the permit form to fill out.  Strata
