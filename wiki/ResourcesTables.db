type³wiki³backlinks³AugustOneHundredGrads ³logname³³text³Summer clearance sale on Earthlite Spirit tables from
these guys, $387 for a table and carrybag, w/non-adjustable
face cradle.  No tax (unless you are shipping to Texas),
no shipping fees, pick your own colors, get a half-round
bolster at their wholesale price of $17.  I'm really 
tempted, but still looking at the used market to start with!

The Bodywork Bulletin Board has a "Tables and Materials" section way
down past the job ads and room/office rental section.  (http://www.abundanthealth.com/bltnbrd.html)

Massage Therapy Supply Co-Op ( http://www.1-Massage.com/ ) has some 
amazing prices on Spirit II tables, namely $368-- not clear what that 
includes.  Looks like an interesting group!  It's in Connecticut, not
clear how you join.  There's an email addr on the "Contact" link, though. Strata

Here's a Spirit Professional Package for $569 which includes adjustable headrest, 
foot bolster, a set of linens, and the good multi-pocket case.  http://www.massagesupplies.com/products.asp?ProductID=1125

Another Spirit-based package, starting at $351 (with no mention of free shipping).  http://www.gotyourback.com/catalog/ptsp.html  They
have a "special" package at $489, which includes a deluxe adjustable face cradle
and the multipocket case.  Order form option for Reiki endplates.  Shipping for $489 is
$40, so this would come to $529.  http://www.gotyourback.com/products.cfm?step=4&s=1&ss=1&c=15&sc=0&p=251  Strata
