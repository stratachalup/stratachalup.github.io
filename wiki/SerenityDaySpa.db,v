@type³wiki³backlinks³AugustOneHundredGrads ³logname³³text³Searching for Biotone Massage Oil (long story), I found a sample business plan for a Day Spa, produced by the University of Pennsylvania's Kutztown Small Business Development Center.  As Dave Barry says, "I am not making this up!"  :-)  Looked pretty comprehensive, may be a good guide for any of us looking to start or get involved with a day spa.  I like their choice of name.
