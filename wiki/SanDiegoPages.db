Favorite Experiences

                     Strolling Through the Gaslamp Quarter: Victorian
                     commercial buildings that fill a 16 1/2-block area will
                     make you think you've stepped back in time. The
                     beautifully restored buildings, in the heart of downtown,
                     house some of the city's most popular shops,
                     restaurants, and nightspots.

                     Renting Bikes, Skates, or Kayaks in Mission Bay:
                     Landscaped shores, calm waters, paved paths, and
                     friendly neighbors make Mission Bay an aquatic
                     playground like no other. Explore on land or water,
                     depending on your energy level, then grab a bite at funky
                     Mission Cafe.

                     Listening to Free Sunday Organ Recitals in Balboa Park: Even if you
                     usually don't like organ music, you might enjoy these outdoor concerts and the
                     crowds they draw--San Diegans with their parents, their children, and their
                     dogs. The music, enhanced by the organist's commentary, runs the gamut
                     from classical to contemporary. Concerts start at 2pm.

                     Relaxing with Afternoon Tea: A genteel tradition in San Diego, the custom
                     of afternoon tea is dignified and old-fashioned at the U.S. Grant Hotel, cozy
                     and Victorian at the Horton Grand, and elegantly charming at the grand Hotel
                     Del Coronado. Take your pick.

                     Taking the Ferry to Coronado: The 15-minute ride gets you out into San
                     Diego Harbor and provides some of the best views of the city. The ferry runs
                     every hour from the Broadway Pier, so you can tour Coronado on foot, by bike,
                     or by trolley, and return whenever you please.

                     Driving Over the Bridge to Coronado: The first time or the fiftieth, there's
                     always an adrenaline rush as you follow this engineering marvel's dramatic
                     curves and catch a glimpse of the panoramic view to either side. Driving west,
                     you can easily pick out the distinctive Hotel Del in the distance long before you
                     reach the "island."

                     Watching the Seals at Children's Pool Beach: This tiny La Jolla cove was
                     originally named for the toddlers who could safely frolic behind a man-made
                     seawall. These days, the sand is mostly off-limits to humans, who congregate
                     along the seawall railing or onshore to admire the protected pinnipeds who sun
                     themselves on the beach or on semi-submerged rocks. You can get
                     surprisingly close, and it's a truly mesmerizing sight.

                     Riding on the San Diego Trolley to Mexico: The trip from downtown costs
                     a mere $2.50, takes only 40 minutes, and the clean, quick trolleys are fun in
                     their own right. Once in Tijuana, load up on colorful souvenirs and authentic
                     Mexican food.

                     Listening to Jazz at Croce's: Ideally located in the center of downtown in a
                     historic Gaslamp Quarter building, Croce's celebrates the life of musician Jim
                     Croce and showcases the city's jazz musicians.

                     Watching the Sun Set Over the Ocean: It's a free and memorable
                     experience. Excellent sunset-watching spots include the Mission Beach and
                     Pacific Beach boardwalks, as well as the beach in Coronado in front of the
                     Hotel del Coronado. At La Jolla's Windansea Beach, wandering down to the
                     water at dusk, wineglass in hand, is a nightly neighborhood event.

                     Drinking Coffee at a La Jolla Sidewalk Cafe: San Diego offers a plethora of
                     places to enjoy lattes, espressos, and cappuccinos, but the coffeehouses in
                     La Jolla serve them up with special panache.

                     Purchasing Just-Picked Produce at a Farmers' Market: Markets
                     throughout the area sell the bountiful harvest of San Diego County.

                     Walking Along the Water: The city offers walkers several great places to
                     stroll. One of our favorites, along the waterfront from the Convention Center to
                     the Maritime Museum, affords views of aircraft carriers, tuna seiners, and
                     sailboats.

                     Visiting the "Lobster Village" in Puerto Nuevo: South of the border, they
                     serve lobster with rice, beans, tortillas, and freshly made salsa; it's an
                     affordable and deliciously filling meal.

                     Floating Up, Up, and Away Over North County: Hot-air balloons carry
                     passengers over the golf courses and luxury homes north of the city. These
                     rides are especially enjoyable at sunset.

                     Watching the Grunion Run: These tiny fish spawn on San Diego beaches
                     between March and August, and the locals love to be there. To find the date of
                     the next run, pick up a free tide chart at a surf shop or consult the daily
                     newspaper.³date³September 12, 2001
