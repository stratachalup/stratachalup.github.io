@type³wiki³backlinks³ ³logname³³text³I totally love Seattle.  I'll organize this stuff better later on, but for now here is something I sent to Mike for one of his co-workers.

And what the heck was the name of that place on the corner in Queen Anne that Rohit and Adam liked so much?

* SeattlePalmList

The Vermont Inn, $69/night as of a receipt dated 9/28/00; they also
have weekly rates that drop it further.  Kitchenette with sink, burner,
small refrigerator, dishes.  I can't recall if there was a microwave
or not-- I think there was.  It's 3 easy blocks toward the water to 
catch any of a number of buses that go directly into Pike's Place,
or further downtown, for free-- it's inside the no-fare zone of the
city center.  And of course, you can't beat it for access to the
Space Needle, museum, etc there-- could also take the monorail into
Westlake center downtown.

A sister hotel, Marvin Gardens, is supposed to be similar but I
never stayed there.

Have your friend check out http://www.seeseattle.org/ which has
coupons and links, as well.  If higher pricing is ok, the Summerfield
Suites over by the convention center were wonderful, as you recall!

For dinner, try to check out the Pink Door at least once, on Post Alley
a block or two out of Pike's Place.  Can sit out on the deck and watch
the sunset and the ferries going back and forth.  Amazing steamed
shellfish with white wine & garlic, yum.  Pink Door, 1919 post alley at 
Virginia, 206-443-3241, tues-sat, 11am - 11pm   

In Pike's place itself, Pikes place brewery, 1415 1st at Union, 206-622-6044, 
thu-sa 11am - 2am, su - wed 11am - 12am, get the nachos w/bbq chicken, yum.

While you're there, walk down and out the back, behind the main market,
and find the India Spice Company, where you can get almost anything
you would want, and some things you didn't know were amazing-- whole
galingale, grains of paradise, cubeb, stick cinnamon (the real stuff
and the imitation), real Turkish bay and California bayleaf, splendid
tea blends, etc.

Thai House II, 517 Queen Anne, no msg, 206-284-3700, lunch & dinner, 
ate w/Mike near VT Inn, very good

International district:  Gagalo chinese, all good, excellent honey 
walnut prawn & chow fun; also Tai Tung, all good, exc bbq duck, and
China Gate, dimsum in evening as well as daytime.

If you are hungry at the end of a long day, and have a friend who likes
the same things you do, the place to end up is The Fisherman Restaurant, 
'home of the seafood feast' on Pier 54 at the end of the building with
the carousel.  A multi-course dinner for any even number of people (2, 4,
etc), you pick a main course and get chowder, steamers, bread, the main
fish, dessert, all included and all served family style in huge dishes.
Mike and I could hardly finish!

Downtown near Gameworks and the big enclosed malls with theatres is
a nice place where I had dinner many a night while working in Seattle.
Von's restaurant & bar (smoke free section in rest), chicken, smoked stuff, 
pine & 6th mid-block dntn. They run their own fruitwood smoker, and it's
great!  If you are a hothead, look for a red plastic bucket by the door
and ask if you don't see it.  They have spicy candy there which is so hot
that even Mike found it to be "kind of intense".  :-)  

Go up to Capitol Hill and visit Twice Sold Tales, a wonderful and huge
used bookstore whose owner, Jamie, also uses her store as a waystation
for homeless cats who are being placed with new owners.  There are cat
bridges across the tops of the stacks, and cat furniture for sale in 
odd corners.  A very friendly place!  If Jamie is in, say hi from Mike
and Strata in California!  At Broadway and Olive on the hill, open
'til 1am most nights.

Further afield, towards the U-District but not quite out there, stop
by Teahouse Kuan Yin, 1911 N 45th, 206 632 2055 Wallinqford and have
a pot of *wonderful* tea.  The owner has spent over a dozen years 
educating herself about teas, and does all her own importing.  You
literally cannot get the kind of stuff she gets in most places!  Chinese
teas like earthy Pu-erh (dirt tea, I call it-- my friend Torin loves it),
Indian red smoky Assam, and vastly more exotic things.  No cellphones
allowed!  :-)  Light munchies, like quiche and samosas, and an assortment
of dessert things.

Have a great time, I'm jealous!  I miss Seattle!
