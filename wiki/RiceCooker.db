<b>What to Cook</b>

* One unit of "stuff" to 3 units of water, 4 units if the "stuff" is brown rice.
* Cutting a paper cup down to about 1/3 size makes a good "scoop".  One scoop of rice and 3 scoops of water makes about one plate of rice (maybe 2 cups).
* Beans usually need 1 - 2 days of soaking in the fridge to soften enough for rice cooker cooking.  Otherwise they come out crunchy in the middle, ick.
* Please don't cook meat, poultry, or seafood in it.  (in our shared office, I was keeping it veggie)
* Dried fruit comes out well, but if you add anything too sugary it may caramelize a little or even scorch, depending on how much liquid is in there.


<b>How to Cook</b>  

* Press the little tab in the front down to the "Cook" position.  It will latch there.  Gently!
* When the stuff is done, or when the water is used up enough that it gets hot enough, the rice cooker will make a soft "ding" and the switch will pop up to "Warm".
* Be sure to unplug the rice cooker when you are done keeping things warm, it will not shut off by itself.
* I don't think you can cause a fire by leaving the rice cooker on warm with either nothing in it or just a little stuff in it, but I don't want to find out.
* Don't try to cook so much that the liquid comes closer than about an inch from the top, it will bubble over while cooking and be a mess.
* If you're not sure, <b>put a plate under it!</b>  A standard dinner plate gives you a slop-over catcher.
** If things are bubbling over and out the sides, try propping up the lid a crack.  This is not going to do for RICE, since that needs a closed system, but for soups or gumbo, it will be fine.

<b>How to Clean</b>

* Only use plastic utensils to scoop stuff out of it, stir stuff in it, and generally interact with it.  
* Don't use anything harder than a plastic sponge to clean it, the nonstick coating might come off.
* Don't get water into the main unit, or immerse it in water.  Just clean the lid and the lift-out insert.
