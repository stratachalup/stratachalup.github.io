@type³wiki³backlinks³ TravelPages³logname³³text³LISA 2000 was in New Orleans, and it was great, except I didn't have any chance to look around and DO stuff.  Here's some info I copied down before the trip.  

I also need to copy down the business card info from some of the fabboo restaurants we went to.  I usually don't like going out to "good" restaurants, the food is too rich, too complicated, too fussy.  Well, not in New Orleans.  Wow.  Just wow!
