StrataChalup and a bunch of other folks took this class from August 20 - 30, 2001.  We had so much fun we didn't want to come home.  :-)

Massage 100 (100 hours)

The purpose of this 100-hour class is to prepare you for entry-level professional work in the massage field. You learn an elegant comprehensive massage sequence
with a strong Swedish/Esalen-style flavor, incorporating elements of Deep Tissue, Rebalancing and Shiatsu in a beautifully interwoven and effective pattern. Not only
will you become skilled at using your hands, but also using your forearms and elbows. In a relaxing, nurturing and supportive environment, Elaine Marie and her
assistants guide you through each stroke. Elaine Marie’s instructional massage video assists you in perfecting your technique and timing. A unique feature of this class
is that you also receive an introduction to Watsu. We encourage you to bring the softness, grace and fluidity of this aquatic experience to your massage practice. The
primary focus will be on touching from a nurturing place of love and respect. Through honoring the “presence,” you learn to ground and center, while working with
your weight and breath.

Prerequisites: None

Class Materials: Notebook and “Anatomy Coloring Book”

Instructor: Elaine Marie³date³September 1, 2001@
