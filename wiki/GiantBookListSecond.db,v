The Great Railup and dancing despite the heat.  A breeze from the sea kept things nice as long as you were in the shade.  We brought our folding chairs, and were happy-- seating was picnic table style, and our chairs were way more comfy!  

The rides were the most nice, family-style, old-fashioned rides I have seen in AGES.  They had lots of rides for very small children, like a little tiny railroad made of tiny pig-shaped cars, ultra-slow tilt-a-whirl type "barrel of monkeys" ride, a water ride with supervision where kids used hand-wheels to paddle little boats, and so on.  Mid-level kid rides like a miniature Scrambler and a tiny rollercoaster were present too, and old-fashioned midway games like pick up the rubber duck and a fishing pole game.  They didn't neglect the Vomit Comet crowd, with various gravity rides too-- we didn't go on anything! :-D

As a bonus, there was a nice Bluebird SP (single-axle rear-engine) onsite, looked like late 80's and absolutely gorgeous.  We asked the vendor who it was parked in behind if it was his, and he said it belonged to the guy who manages the amusements company.  He lives in it about 8 months a year and goes along with the company from Florida to NY and in the central states, pulling the Fair office trailer with it.  The vendor had been trying to get the guy to sell it to him for over a year.  ;-)  We thought about trying to go behind the barrier and talk to the owner, but he was meeting with various folks at the table under the trailer awning and we didn't want to interrupt just to ogle his 'bird.  Not only was it in awesome shape, everything matched, including the trailer, the chairs, the awnings.  Very very slick.  We could see the bumper cutout lines that shows he has the Holland-style swing-out radiator mod on it, too.  Yearn, yearn...

Another interesting vehicle was present as well-- the Spam Mobile!  Yes, Hormel has a giant RV done up as a travell
