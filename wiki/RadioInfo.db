Statement this morning (Tues, Sept 11) on a mailing list, from the local Assistant District Coordinator:

  146.115  (Silicon Valley Emergency Communications System)
  145.230  (Palo Alto ARC) (corrected from Stanford ARC)
  145.270  (South Peninsula ECS, Palo Alto Red Cross)
  146.925  (Coastside Amatuer Radio Club, CARDA search dogs)
  146.850  (San Mateo County, sherrif-related traffic)
  147.015  (Fremont-Union City-Newark area)
  
  Most channels are quiet, but most groups are on self-activated
  standby, monitoring the channels, and waiting for an official
  activation..."You will be told where to go, and what to do". ;-)

  Trains are also affected. Most commuters are 2+hour delayed, due
  to delays to allow rail PD folks to search inside and outside the
  commuter trains, as well as slowing freight to do "rolling
  inspections", but at one point UP halted anything on a passenger
  route, and waited for the High Railers (pick-up trucks with 
  extra steel train wheels) to pass and inspect all sections of
  track before the trains could move again. Mail reports indicate
  that similar events took place around L.A., so this may well
  have been a system-wide precaution by Union Pacific. (160.32 in
  the SF Bay Area...)
