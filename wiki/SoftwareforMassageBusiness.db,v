@type³wiki³backlinks³AugustOneHundredGrads ³logname³³text³Found this by accident, looks pretty slick!  There's a $39 and a $69 version.  Generate reminders when folks don't pay, get reminders of client's birthdays, how long they've been a client, etc.  There's even a spa/clinic version which has a room scheduler.  http://www.landsw.com/massage.htm  Joe Strata sez check it out!  :-)
