It appears that, with AtisWiki, if two people edit the same page at the same
time, the updates from the one who committed first will be lost.  (Well, they're
still in RCS.)  If this happens to you, you can find your version in the Backup
Copies, copy the changed section, and edit the modern version to include your changes.

One of these days I'll get around to making HTML diff displays and merge utilities.
