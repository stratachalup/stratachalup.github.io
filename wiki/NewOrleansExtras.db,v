Accent Annex, for mardigras jewelery, esp RedRose Beads, Riverwalk store or 633 Touloume St

Gambino's Bakery, king cakes, 504-822-3340 or 504-885-7500, KC02 is basic cake w/fun packet.  We got a KingCake for CatOkita and TomLimoncelli's birthday party at LISA 2000, and it was great.

Locals say that Charles Square (I think that's right!) is
the best place to go for Mardis Gras, since it's where all
the families go and there's not the wildness that you find at the other locations.³date³September 12, 2001@
