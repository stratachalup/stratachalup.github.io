A rest! An actual rest! Faywood Hot Springs all day today, hurray.  We got up and worked on the coach a little.  We lubed all the window slides with silicone spray, and had our Daily Scare while unrolling the awning to shade the coach.  Some of the bolts holding the alumnium cover/top of the awning to the roof are corroded, and one is missing.  Mike seals the hole with silastic and also seals the area where the Winegard antenna mount is fubared up on the roof.  It's original equipment, and has had a tough life.  Mike naps, and Strata goes off to the RV'ers pool area, which is partially shaded.  A pleasant afternoon follows, with a couple of other ladies, a small girl, and a visiting cat. The cat doesn't care that we all have wet hands, it just wants to be petted!  One lady lays face down on a chaise lounge to take a nap, and the little cat jumps up and snuggles itself under her arm to nap along.  She's never met this cat before, but apparently she has this effect on many cats-- instant love!  Very cute.  
<p>
All the cats we've met here so far are very nice.  The gentleman working the front desk said they used to have a rattlesnake problem here until they brought in the cats.  I don't know if the cats actually catch rattlers, or if they catch the prey the rattlers would have caught, or what.  The folks here have taken good care of the land as they develop the place.  They've been very careful to save and work around the large cacti, and seem to be doing a minimal-impact philosophy.   They're building a new entrance road and a visitor center.  We're very tempted to come back and stay for a month or so and see if we could help.
<p>
After dinner, Mike and I go back to the RV pools and have another nice chat with some folks there.  One guy is an older fellow who is on a second career, and has become a certified massage therapist.  He encouraged us to get out of the rat race and find things we liked to do, rather than doing what we knew and found stressful.  Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

Deming NM to Tucson AZ; Crazy Horse RV Park.  We're up early, ready to be out by 9:15am or so.  Pretty darn good for us.  ;-)  We end up chatting with Doug, the fellow in the vintage Airstream next to us.  It's a classic, a 1967 I believe he said.  He's mounted a marine-type brass propane heater on a pole at the front dinette.  The table portion of the dinette is a gorgeous cherrywood slab that an artist/woodworker friend made for him.  He's still working on the back portion of the trailer, but the front is very sharp and still very homey.  Nice!!
<p>
I was reading a wonderful book on zoos, whose name now escapes me, and I can't find the library receipt now.  It was about all the things both wrong and right in zoo design over the last 100 years, and pioneering work folks are doing with habitat design.  The author lists five pioneering establishments who are doing a number of the Right Things, and I'm looking forward to visiting one of them soon, namely the Arizona Sonora Desert Museum in Tucson AZ.  The other sites he names are Wildscene in Bristol England, the Apenheul Primate Park in Apeldoorn Holland, Artis in Emmen Holland, and the Noorder Dierenpark in Emmen Holland.  
<p>
My fiction selection for this trip has been Queen City Jazz, by Kathleen Ann Goonan.  Nanotech meets post-holocaust, with some odd twists and a musical bent.  There are some wild and nifty ideas here, and when I got back home I snagged the sequel, Mississippi Blues and really enjoyed that.  Using Amazon to check the author's name, I found there's a 3rd novel in the same set, Crescent City Rhapsody.  Wups!  I'll have to see if Sunnyvale carries it, or maybe snag it from the county library.  
<p>
We finally get on the road at 10am, and have a long nasty haul in a strong headwind.  We can't get the coach up over 50 mph, and the wind is strong enough that it gradually pushes the mirrors back on one side.  Yeesh.  We stop at the rest stop on Chiricahua summit, make a bite of lunch, swap drivers and finally get to Tucson around 3:30pm.  Staying at Crazy Horse RV Park, 1-10 exit 268.  It's ok but mostly the least expensive local alternative, given there are a lot of luxury parks.  $22.50/night for 50 amp service, alas no cable.  ;-)  
<p>
We scoot off to the local Camping World at exit 264, and then find a Chinese buffet a few blocks down.  Yum!
<p>

Another rest! Amazing! Sonora Desert Museum, Pima Air Museum.  Up early, and arrive at the Desert Museum around 9:15am.  Wow, an awesome place.  We stay until about 2:30, having seen only about a quarter of the place, but "I'm sorry teacher, my brain is full."  The hummingbird aviary was closed, so we'll have to come back sometime just for that.  We zoomed off to the Air Museum and got a bit over 2 hours in until they closed, very strictly, at 4:50pm.  I think we only saw about a tenth of that collection.  
We really need to be heading back home, so we can't stay and re-visit.  We had also wanted to tour Biosphere 2, and that will have to wait until another time as well.  There are many, many interesting things to do around Tucson.  I'm looking forward to planning an extended stay sometime.  
<p>
Mike measures the gas tank this evening and finds that the manual is wrong, the tank is 100 - 110 gallons volumetrically, not 150.  Another data point.

Tucson AZ to Quartzsite AZ; Shady Lane RV Park.  We are finally getting the hang of this early rising thing, maybe, and get up in time to go see my Cousin Bobby at 10am.  Unfortunately we arrive late, having had a lot of trouble starting the coach.  Hmm.  Not sure what's up with that.  Bobby is a really talented photographer, and showed us some spectacular scenics (his specialty) in 11x15 or 11x20 format.  Nice!!  His house is pretty amazing too, and he's done all the decorating himself with a Southwest theme.  We would have like to stay and visit longer, and felt bad about not doing so, but wanted to make Quartzsite before full dark.
<p>
After gassing up the Bird with 64 gallons of premium, representing 6.05 mpg on the way here, we got on the highway about 1:30pm.  I had been thinking we should turn on the CB and listen to what was going on, and didn't listen to myself.  We promptly hit a huge traffic jam, and turning on the CB found it was from a big accident ahead, backed up for miles.  Argh.  We just missed the last place to get onto the frontage road to detour around it, too.  The accident, when we finally passed it around milepost 231, was quite horrific, involving a big rig that had shredded itself along the median area.  It looked as if the driver had hit the windshield from the inside, and we can't imagine he or she would have survived.  Baruch dayan emet.  Very sad.
<p>
We didn't reach Phoenix until 4pm, and ended up mixing in with their rush hour traffic, not too bad but not great either.  We arrived at Shady Lane RV Park just as the campground hosts were leaving for the night-- phew!  Good thing!  They were incredibly nice folks, and had us follow them into the site, helped us hook up, and chatted for a while.  The coach interior had gotten very warn, so I turned on the overhead AC units for the first time, in fan-only mode.  The overnight temperatures were only around 55 degrees, so we might have boondocked after all if we'd realized, oh well.  Mike tries to get the TV antenna working again, since it worked fine last night in Tucson.  Not much luck.  There's no cable anywhere in town they say, and there's road work.  Given that the backhoe is the natural enemy of communications gear, I bet I know what happened!
<p>
<b>Thurs Feb 21</b><br>
Quartzsite AZ to Desert Hot Springs; Sam's Family Hotsprings RV Park.  We pull out of Shady Lane around 11:30am, after getting email again via the front office.  Usually that's allowed only after 6pm, but the guy at the desk was really nice and let me on for about 5 minutes.  No local Earthlink numbers here, so I used the calling card and the Phoenix number.
<p>
We are, alas, too late for the main part of the Quartzsite experience.  Most of the vendors have left, and the concerts, workshops, and similar activity is long since over.  There are still scattered pockets of flea market activity, however, and we head over to the area called "the Main Event".  Shopping around there we find a guy specializing in tow hitch equipment, with a number of good used Blue Ox towbars.  Ouch, if only we'd known, we could have stopped in on our way TO Dallas and picked up one for about half of what we paid for our Roadmaster.  Well, now we know.  We got some good towing cables to replace those obnoxious chains, and paid $30 or so less than the same kit in the Camping World catalog.  We begin to understand why Quartzsite is the annual pilgramage and big-item-shopping stop.  
<p>
Annoyingly, the LP mode of the refrigerator, working fine until now, quits while we are parked at Quartzsite.  We will need to run the generator while going down the road if we want the stuff in the fridge to stay happy.  Probably cumulative dust, since we ran into a heck of a dust storm a day or so ago.  Add another item to the to-do list.
<p>
We had a big adventure and our Daily Scare trying to get into Sky Valley RV Park in Desert Hot Springs CA.  Suffice it to say that we should have known better when they wouldn't take reservations.  After some tight maneuvering around their park to the truly awful "limited service" area of shared 30 amp service on a gravel lot, we decided "no way".  We managed to get out without unhitching by dint of very tricky maneuvering, including circling around a gentleman's camp fire at the end of the lot.  We committed most every mistake in the book here, even though we knew better-- didn't scout ahead on foot before going in, let the coach get too low on gas, did a lot of stop and start with a hot radiator.  Our temp hit 200 at several points, since there was a local heat wave with temps in the 90s.  We did a teeth-gritting white-knuckle ride into town, hoping we'd make the gas station and wouldn't overheat on the hills back along the way.  Fortunately it was downhill most of the way, and we dropped back into the 175 - 180 range.  Later we found that even 200 isn't a cause for fear on a Ford 534, that the "worry point" is more like 240.  Now we know, but we didn't know then!
<p>
We got back to Dillon and Palm Drive, and called Sam's Family RV Park which we had seen and passed by.  Good choice, and we'd come back there any time!  Friendly folks, a nice office and general store, and really nice pools and facilities.  We got in a late night soak at the hot pools before they closed, then saw most of "Never Say Never" on TV.
<p>
<b>Fri Feb 22</b><br>
Desert Hot Springs CA to Avila Beach CA; Avila Hot Springs RV Park.  We did a big push through LA today.  We departed at 10am to time ourselves through the traffic, and it worked out great.  Mind you, even non-rush-hour traffic in LA sucks rocks, and we were not happy by the time we got out of the basin.  There were record high temps, so we turned toward 101 via 134 from 210, figuring it would be cooler by the ocean.  We didn't want to try running the Grapevine in 100 degree weather, especially since we thought our thermostat might be stuck open.  
<p>
We stopped for lunch at Ventura, having the huge public parking lot at Buena Ventura beach mostly to ourselves.  There were a few other RVs, and some folks strolling.  We watched some firemen arrive and set up cones in part of the lot.  They were teaching some of their folks how to tandem drive the big hook and ladder trucks.  Mike and I took a walk on the beach, which was great fun, and a welcome cool-off from the hot hot day.  It was already 83 degrees by noon, and that big block engine right next to our feet puts out a ton of heat.  Fortunately the sea has more cool than my feet had heat.  :-)  Lots of cute lizards scampered off curbsides as we walked back to the coach.
<p>
Made a lot of calls when we hit 5-bar digital service in Santa Barbara, trying to find a place to tune up the coach when we get back home.  "Ford 534?  Wow, I remember that engine, but it's older than the guys I've got working for me in the shop.  Sorry!"  We'll try Salinas or the Central Valley since Mike says the 534 was used primarily as an agricultural engine.  We learned a new litle factoid, namely that there used to be a Ford 636 diesel engine.  They didn't think it was going to take off, so they licensed it to Cat, where it became the Cat 1100 and later the Cat 3208.  Wups!  That's right up there with MIT's decision to license core memory to IBM for the flat fee of $50K rather than a half-cent per core.  After all, it's not like they'll be making a LOT of computers, they're too expensive!  ;-)
<p>
We continued on to Avila Beach RV Park, got situated, and unhitched the Echo in search of some dinner out.  We ended up down in the old Port of San Luis, and observed with interest the overnighting RVs at the public wharf areas.  We'll have to try that sometime!  We had snagged a local paper at the front desk, and the Old Port Inn sounded like a good place to try.  Wow.  It was a little spendy, but completely amazing.  They have these odd tables, too, with a porthole looking down into the water under the wharf.  Not much to see at night, but I imagine it's interesting during the daytime.  The fish market further down the dock looked good, but was closed.  A cute sign warned customers about sticking one's hands into the "pick your own" crab tank:  "Crabs have claws and will pinch your fingers!" 
<p>
Got back to the rig late, and turned in.  The pools closed at 9pm, so we chose dinner over soaking, but will get a dip in the morning.  They open at 8am, and checkout time is noon!  The waterslide opens at 11am, hmm.
<p>
<b>Sat Feb 23</b><br>
Avila Beach CA to Sunnyvale CA; home!!  We soaked for quite a while in the pools, and had fun chatting with some folks there.  Mike was talking to a couple who have done a lot of camper and RV travelling and are hotspring fans, and I met some older ladies who alternated swimming and soaking to get their daily exercise for a few hours.   The main soaking pool was hot hot hot, and they checked the temperature and found it to be about 109.  No wonder!  They turned off the inflow of hot for a while and it got better.  Mike and I both scalded our shins a little, and put aloe on later.  Going from the high-70's or low-80's pool to the hot soak area was pretty dramatic, but doing it a few times really gets your blood moving.  Normally they keep the hot area at a max of 103 or 104, which is much easier to take than 109!
<p>
Mike drove all the way home, and it was a very pretty drive.  The hills were green, there was minimal traffic, and it all worked out well.  We were both really ready to quit by the time we got home, though, and had to offload the tools into the Echo, find a parking place in the neighborhood for the coach, transfer things out of the bin that doesn't lock, etc.  The fluffs were glad to see us, and the apartment was really nice, since the Critter Care folks had vacuumed it that day.  It seemed like it would be hard to leave the apartment, but already two weeks later I am impatient to be out of here and back on the road.
<p>
Finis...for now.
