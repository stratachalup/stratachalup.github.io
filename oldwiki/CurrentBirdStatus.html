<h3>new interior look</h3>
I mentioned in email earlier that I'd gotten the sofa throw that I'd been indecisive about for the past 6 months, and that it had enough extra to cover other cushions nearby.  
<p>
I like the <a href="<a href="http://kgate.virtual.net/birdwanderings/mobybird/interior/Websize/LR-carpet-n-table.jpg">new"">http://kgate.virtual.net/birdwanderings/mobybird/interior/Websize/LR-carpet-n-table.jpg">new</a> couch & cushion covers</a> a LOT.  Yay!  Compare with <a href="<a href="http://kgate.virtual.net/birdwanderings/mobybird/remodel2002/couches-post-and-pre-reupholstery.JPG">this"">http://kgate.virtual.net/birdwanderings/mobybird/remodel2002/couches-post-and-pre-reupholstery.JPG">this</a> old photo of the dual couches</a>.

I'm much happier.  :-)   This has been about a year gradually coming together.

This is slightly less than normal clutter, but not by too much.  Except the kitchen table, which was freshly decluttered only a few days ago.  
<h3>much happens, little is written</h3>
I'm working, and work takes Lots of Time.  I spent some time today finally putting together the little picture how-to on potting plants-- it's located at <a href="http://kgate.virtual.net/potting.html"">http://kgate.virtual.net/potting.html</a>

<h3>savoring the little pleasures<br>
Weds 8/12/03</h3>
In this case, literally, as I take time out to eat the yummy turkey chili I made last night.  After work I charged home and got stuff done-- a suitable antidote to banging my head against the wall all day at work yesterday.
<li>went to the store on the way to get cereal (yay, breakfast in the morning)
<li>stopped at the laundry building on the way into the park, where I retrieved and folded a couple of loads that Mike had hung on the line earlier
<li>started a huge pot of short-grain brown rice
<li>put away groceries
<li>washed dishes cluttering sink
<li>found and deployed the tiny mesh tent to keep fruit flies out of the fruit bowl
<li>made turkey chili for lunches today & tomorrow, put away in fridge
<li>separated the rice in half-- to eat with chili and to make sushi
<li>separated the other half of rice in half, added shiro/ume packet to one, miso-salmon packet and sesame-seed/seaweed sprinkle to the other, seasoned rice vinegar to both, folded until cool, and packed away in fridge for dinner tonight with cucumber, avocado, fake krab, and smoked salmon
<li>watered the lawn during all this (place sprinkler, wait half hour, move sprinkler, repeat about 5 times for our oddly shaped little patch of lawn)
<li>watered the plants
<li>talked plants with the neighbor and his dad-in-law, gave them some cosmos seeds left over from deadheading cosmos last week; he says neighbor in corner can tell me what's wrong with my squash plants (yay)
<li>rigged impromptu supports from wire coathangers for bell pepper plant and lone uncaged tomato, both of which are bearing so copiously that were leaning precariously
<li>got most of the way through the excellent book (thanks for the reminder DaveC!) "No Apparent Danger"; finished it this morning.
<p>
Yay! As a bonus, I was completely stalled on working with that tool this morning, but shifted to doing the outline of the tool tutorial which is due Friday.  Got the first draft of that *done*, and just got a message about the tool.  Heh-- their bug! Internal compiled-in pathing messed up in subtool pieces, will fix in the next rev by Friday, and I have a work-around from engineering.  Yippee! 
<p>
Obligatory-dour-New-England-comment: Something bad might happen because I'm this happy.  (But I sure hope not)

<h3>back to work!<br>
Tuesday 8/11/03</h3>
I'd forgotten about the domino effect of a traditional work week. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad to be working, but still...  Last week, when I started work on Thursday, I brought lunch since I had cooked and made extra in my usual way.  Saturday I don't cook things explicitly to save ahead since it's Shabbos and I don't like to do that.  
<p>
Sunday, we went up to the Novato Renn Fair, since it was the last day and Mike said he'd go up with me.  We had a great time, but got back after 8:30pm and just did a stirfry of some broccolini and mushrooms that we'd cut but not cooked the night before.  
Last night, we had scheduled to meet a friend for dinner who we hadn't seen since we'd left town in May 2002.  We met at Fresh Choice and closed the place out, leaving around 9:30pm-- about a half hour later than I would have liked, even though I enjoyed seeing her.  Got to bed at 11pm, no time to cook anything.  
<p>
Got up this morning at 7:30am, almost left in "time" at 8:30 to be at work by 9.  One of my cats was acting unusually sluggish this morning, though, so we stopped to diagnose and see if she needed any help-- I don't think so, Mike's going to check at around noon after he gets back from an outing he had planned.  So I didn't leave until 8:51am, which put me in Sunnyvale at 9:15am.  
<p>
I still had to stop at the store, which I didn't have time to do last night because we stayed so late at dinner, to get something for breakfast and for lunch.  So now I am stuck here until at least 5:45, or longer if I take a break for lunch instead of working through lunch and eating at my desk.   And add another 10 minutes for doing this  update.  Sheesh.
<p>
OK, they're not holding the clock on me, I can pick my own hours, but it all adds up, and on my current sleep schedule I start to conk out around 9:30pm or so and really need to be in "winding down getting ready for bed" mode by that point.  I'm waking up at 7 - 7:30am, but it takes a solid hour to get up and out (shower, dress, breakfast, cat food & water, etc).  I'd like to get into a mode of getting up at 6am and having an hour or so in the morning to check my email and take care of house business stuff (bills, cards, etc).  I'd also really like to move to Sunnyvale and be 5 mins instead of 20 - 30 mins away during rush hour to n fro.  Oh well.  
<p>
Like I said, it's been a LONG time (Fall 2001) since I've had a "go to the office every day and stay all day" type of contract, and it's going to take some adjusting again.
<h3>visitations, dim sum yum, boba musing<br>
Sunday 7/27/03</h3>
My back was feeling much better this morning (yay multiple icings yesterday) and we went off to get dim sum at Mayflower in Milpitas Square. We got there about 1:30pm. There's less of a selection, but we only had to wait about 15 - 20 minutes to get in. :-) Mmmm, folded rice noodle, fried taro ball, chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, egg-yolk bun, radish cake, and duck! We felt decadently stuffed afterwards, but ...for dessert of course we had to get boba, having seen umpteen glasses go by while waiting outside.
<p>
Fantasia Tea's almond is very astringent, but their lychee is heavenly, with bits of fruit in it as well as the flavor! Guess I'll get *that* one next time, though Mike is a sweetie and gave me sips of his. Makes me wonder about their passionfruit, another favorite of mine. The Fantasia Tea glass said they had stores on Santana Row and the Eastridge Mall, as well as another location in Cupertino and in Newark. I'm unable to find a web pointer to them, which surprises me. The other thing that they do Very Right is that their boba were the best textured I've had-- mostly melty but with a chewy core. Some places have the boba so chewy that you think your jaw is going to give out by the bottom of the cup!
<p>
<p>
Riding the Boba Bubble? Maybe.
There are either 3 or 4 boba shops/cafes in Downtown View at this point, maybe 5 if you count the teahouse that happens to have boba. I'm really thinking that I should try to get a part-time shift in a boba shop somewhere and try to learn the business. I don't think the peak of the bubble (pardon the pun) has hit yet and when one looks up the wholesale ingredients from various suppliers, the profit margin at retail is ludicrous. It might even surpass espresso, since the machinery required is common and minimal in comparison. I found some interesting numbers online.
<p>
I was thinking out loud to Mike as we headed out that Starbuck's might be sweating a little, or planning to introduce some boba products of their own. The article I linked above, from 2002, said they'd been thinking about it but had no plans to do so at the time. Most of the boba places I've been have either coffee or mocha flavored drinks, and some even brew espresso. I'm certainly not the only one speculating about this.
<p>
Sure, some boba shops like the little one on Castro near Red Queen chinese have fancy machinery from the boba distributor's line, like the machine that bonds a flat seal on top of the plastic glass. You poke a sharp-end straw through like you do on a juice box. Interesting idea, but having one machine limits how well you can deal with a customer rush even with several folks making the drinks.
<p>
It's clear to me as a customer that there's tremendous variety in the quality of the preparations, and that the traditional way of displaying the menus leaves a lot to be desired for the new customer. I think a "New to Boba?" card like the "Sushi Novice?" cards would be a good idea, as would alternate menu displays. In particular, I'd like to make a posterboard size menu with "Confused? Try this--" on the top, and several subheadings with 2 or 3 choices under each: Tasty Tea, Sweet & Spicy, Sweet & Fruity, Tart/Sour. A bonus category called Dare to Explore might feature one from each category, like Green tea, Hazelnut, Jackfruit, Soursop. In addition, there should be two sizes of prep cups for syrups, a standard and a less-sweet version, and folks should be able to choose. For the systems which rely on pumped syrup, I'm not sure how to work it-- some I've seen require multiple handle pulls, which would be easy to adapt. Others dispense the "right" amount with one pull, which seems to be the point of a pump in the first place.
<p>
Wandering over to get bubble tea, we nose-pressed a little in the Swarovski store along the way. Mike's mom collects crystal, mostly Lalique. I like the little brushed gold or silver jewelery bits with the chips of zircon or other stuff in them. Someday I'll get a set of those fat brushed matte silver/white-gold links with little chips of blue topaz in them. Mostly I see them with zircon or diamond, but I like blue topaz better! Sapphire's nice too, though. :-) Well, first the remanufactured iBook, new back tires (x4, duallies) for Birdie, the chunk of land and many other things.
<p>
<h3>saturday 26th july, 16th hour, 25th instant<br>
stupid, stupid, stupid...</h3>
<p>
Slightly dumb thing: I was having fun yesterday afternoon and when I paid attention again to what time it was, it was too late for me to get my follow-up/tune-up at the chiropractor.
<p>
REALLY dumb thing: So this morning when I was having a few twinges I thought, I'll try to do a stretch that duplicates what the chiropractor did to adjust me. The only even vague handwaving I can offer in self-defense is that I hadn't really had any caffeine yet, and it had been long enough since my back really really hurt (over 2 weeks) that I'd forgotten just how intensely painful it could be.
<p>
The obvious happened, and now instead of either a fun but weird campout in the Sierras with friends OR a fun but low-key day with Mike (who was insomniac and skipped track crew today at the railroad museum), I am having neither. I am having a non-fun day with ice and the leftover vicodin from the Big Back Thing 2+ years ago.
<p>
When, when, when, will I ever learn? Sigh. This too shall pass, and quickly, I hope.
<p>
Bonus point factor: If I'd actually gone on the 6-hour drive to the campout, the drive I was afraid would make my back do more than twinge, I wouldn't have had the time to experiment with stretches to try to "fix" it, and wouldn't be having this problem.
<p>
mood: ow...ow, ow, ow, ow.....
<p>
<h3>2003-07-25 20:46:00; <br>
quasi-productive week update</h3>
Still no word on job stuff, despite repeated promises of knowing "for sure" by Wednesday at the 10am follow-up meeting, then later Wednesday afternoon, then by Thursday afternoon, then by Friday afternoon. Sigh.
<p>
<b>home biz moves forward</b><br>
Spent some time Wednesday evening and most of Thursday daytime online gathering info on suppliers for my part-time business. I also took advantage of a massive sale on baskets and decent faux greenery/flowers at Michael's crafts to get what I need for my display table.  I got the resale license/ID numbers a week or two ago. I haven't ordered anything yet, but I've got a spreadsheet started. The good news is that what I'll be making (sachet bags) is relatively quick and easy. I still have to make up a batch and see how they do in a fair market, though. I've always thought that the kinds I like are pretty pricey. Now I know why-- if you get the materials from 3rd or 4th tier resellers, they cost quite a bit to assemble. If you go up to primary mfrs or 1st/2nd tier resellers, which takes more digging, you can knock a lot off the price even in small-crafts quantities (50 - 500) of things. I still have to run the numbers and see what kind of volume I would need to do in order to make "real" money, though. It's definitely a "dinner and CD's" kind of business, not a "rent and food" kind of business. At least, in this location. In FL for the winter, it might actually come close to making a dent in rent. ;-) 
<p>
<b>...in a cleaner little world</b><br>
Did a grand mal cleaning this afternoon/early evening. A friend had dropped by unexpectedly and was far too polite to notice that I hadn't swept in several days. I decided it was Very Much Time, and not only swept, but dragged the carpeting outside, did spot cleaning and brushing, and washed the floors. We chose the carpet color well; it was truly frightening how much invisible cat hair came off the couch corner and the engine cover where the cats brush by all the time to get to their food & water under the driver's seat and steering wheel. One of the best things about having redone the interior is that since we have tile and small floor carpets, a broom and mop/swiffer suffices-- no freaking out the cats. They know, with the bone-deep surety of instinct, that the innocuous object that we know as "the vacuum cleaner" is really Akuume', Eater of Souls. Naturally, fleeing in terror is the only appropriate response. It's nice to be able to clean the coach without feeling like I'm taking days off the lives of the cats.
<p>
<b>blackberry walking</b><br>
I have many blackberries (half a hat full, in fact), picked on the return arc of the walk I took Thursday evening with Mike and a friend of ours. They have been walking regularly in the early evening, and I have wussed out up to now. They're both the type to say, "hey, let's keep going" and do a 2 or 2.5 hour walk instead of an hour walk, and I don't do well with that yet. But we established that I could turn back when I wanted to and they could keep going, and so I did and they did and there were all these wonderful blackberries along the way to occupy me. :-) Most are not ripe yet, so I will go back every few days. The best, of course, are unreachable, growing on the other side of the fences along the flood control canal and the footbridges. Oh well! We went to La Costena afterwards and I got my LC mole fix-- they do the best mole, not too spicy, just really good!
<p>
<b>trash, treasures, taste lapses, all racked together</b><br>
I had a lovely afternoon today prowling a vintage shop in SJ with a friend. It's extremely rare that I would find anything in a vintage shop to fit me, and this was no exception, though I was tempted by a lovely cornflower-blue burnt velvet scarf with many tiny leaves over it. It matched what I was wearing, but that was T-shirt and capris, a color match rather than a fashion match. I was sorely tempted, but passed it by.
<p>
I did, however, find a very excellent narrow tie, and was reminded that I need more button-down shirts with which to wear ties. I have not been dressing as (cough) aggressively as I would like to these days, and I do want to be what I consider properly dressed next time I go to King of Clubs for karaoke. I did a vaguely credible rendition of "Shock the Monkey" last time, with no more liquid courage than a couple of oversized shirley temples. If I manage to get over there once a month, I'll consider myself inordinately brave. :-) 
<p>
<b>errandy bits</b><br>
Off to the supermarket for milk and to get different eggs-- the ones we got last week elsewhere seem to be marginal. Not past due date or anything, but we made scrambled eggs for breakfast recently and both felt a bit queasy afterwards and had Disturbed Digestion for the rest of the day. "When in doubt, throw it out!"
