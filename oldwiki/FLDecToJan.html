Boo is much better, and has been keeping things down.  We need to make sure that the whole
pipeline is enabled (to put it delicately), so we're keeping a close eye on both the food bowl
and the litter box.  If she seems fine tomorrow, we may try to go to Epcot.  In which case I 
ought to be asleep already, but am not yet (wups).  
<p>
Temp tonight in the low/mid 30's, both heaters going.  Sunny Florida.  I love it!  No rain on
the weather sked through Tuesday, which is something at least.   Mike tried some RTTY work on
the radio today, but the bands weren't cooperating.  He and I are studying together in the morning,
15 - 20 minutes of Talmud (via Joseph Telushkin books) and 15 - 20 minutes of ham radio (I'm
studying for my General class).  I've gotten so I can pass the online tests for several days
in a row, but we're only about a third of the way through the question pool.  And then of course
I'll have to pass Element 1, Morse code at 5 words per minute, as well.  First the written stuff,
then we'll mess with Morse.  I hope to take Element 3, the written test, at the Orlando or Miami
ham radio conventions, the first and second weekends in February.  Here's hoping!
<p>
We went out and saw The Two Towers a few days ago.  I'm miffed at how it's diverging from the book,
but I have read the book(s) roughly annually since sometime in high school, so you can understand
a little frustration.  No, I don't speak or write Elvish, etc, not the Tolkien equivalent of a Trekkie,
but there definitely are some not-so-minor tweaks to the characters and story line.  Still amazing how
many things are great in the movie, though, so it's not like I hate it or anything.  OK, long past Z time,
must sleep!

We're getting thunderstorms and/or cold fronts every few days, ugh.
The change in temperature from a 75 degree day to a 65 degree one
doesn't sound like much, but with it comes going from 50 degrees
at night to 30 degrees.  Me, Mike, *and* the cats have all had a
bit of postnasal drip, and Boo has been worrying us with wheezing a
little and acting ill.  We took her to the vet yesterday, and they
said her chest was clear and that they couldn't feel any blockages.
<p>
She had been refusing tuna for a couple days, and Snark had taken
the Boss Cat role, so we knew she wasn't feeling good.  Yesterday
she seemed her usual self, but we'd already vowed to take her in
to the vet for a checkup.  At around 3am tonight, the wind of the
cold front coming woke me up, and I got up and tossed on clothes
to take down our awning, which was flapping.  We're a bit paranoid
about the awning, given that it's new this summer due to our leaving
the old one up in a rainstorm.  No rain, just cold and howling winds--
I thought Florida was supposed to be nice!!  
<p>
At around 4am I woke up smelling something bad, and Boo had dropped
a big wet turd just outside the litter box.  I was hearing an odd
flapping/scratching, which turned out to be her trying to pull up
the bathmat to cover it up (just as well she didn't succeed at this),
and that's what got me out of bed.  While cleaning that up, I heard
a cat coughing up, and Boo vomited up a huge quantity of wet catfood.
There was also another cat barf over by the water bowl, and some of the
droppings over by the food bowl!  I think she was trying to eat more
and got sick.
<p>
So by the time I cleaned all *that* up, boy was I awake.  I gave both
cats some of the Laxatone (like Petromalt, for hairballs) that I'd
gotten at the vet, and couldn't get back to sleep.  Plus Boo was 
being very bouncy and wanted to play with her (very noisy) hazelnut
or jump around on all the tabletops and rustle papers.  Around 11am this
morning, Boo vomited again, and passed a lot of partly-digested
cat kibble.  She's drinking lots of water, but seems happier and 
more bright-eyed than in the last couple of days.  I'm worried, but
the vet says her blood work came back ok and that they have Saturday
hours and a Sunday emergency coverage-- take away the kibble, feed 
her small meals and keep up with the Laxatone, and see what happens
is what the vet says to do.  
<p>
Didn't mean to get so lengthy. I am
worried about Boo but we'll keep a close close eye on her!

I woke up this morning at about 4:15am because the wind was really whacking the coach.  Didn't see anything but "windy" on the usual weather page so I went digging for any NOAA alerts or warnings and found that "SUSTAINED WINDS OUT OF THE WEST AND NORTHWEST ARE EXPECTED TO REACH 25 MPH...WITH GUSTS UP TO 40 MPH POSSIBLE. ... RESIDENTS SHOULD SECURE LOOSE OBJECTS OR MOVE THEM INDOORS..."   Right.  And then go the heck back to sleep...if possible....sigh. 
<p>
So the lawn chairs (very soggy) are now cabled to the bike which is cabled to the picnic table, and if those move we've got bigger stuff to worry about, like whether there'll be Ruby Slippers for both me and Mike or if one of us will have to try carrying the other and clicking our heels together.  Anyway.
<p>
A big PTHTHTHT to the NOAA weather page subjobs that didn't think that advisory needed to go on the main Clermont page, or I'd have done this before we went to bed last night.  Double PTHTHT that we missed the tornado warning activation for 13 counties including this one (Lake) last night, due to the same f**d allegedly authentic page. "Hmm, warm sustained dry winds between rain showers, we'd better check the weather page. Nope, don't see any alerts for Clermont or Leesburg."
<p>
<a href="http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/fl/allwarnings.html"">http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/fl/allwarnings.html</a> is Da Man from now on.   And <a href="http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/fl/watches.html"">http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/fl/watches.html</a> is His First Lady.  And I'm going to see if I can get the heck back to sleep. You bet I'm irritated.  But thank G-d we're safe and all is well!
<p>
Note from later today: We dusted off the Rat Shack weather alert radio, and are going to leave it on during the day in the coach.  
Meanwhile, Mike's up on the roof making sure that his antennas are still well-secured after last night and this morning's winds.

Mike took another bike ride around the place for about 45 minutes, and later we both got a nice 40+ minute lap swim in at the pool over in Verandah.  Brrrrrr to start with, but then ok by the time we'd been moving a bit.  A few rainstorms swept in and we kept an ear out for thunder!  The only other beings in the pool were a couple of kids from Ontario-- their grandma watched from the porch, out of the rain.  Our reward for a good swim was to head back to Crossroads for a soak, the jacuzzi being refilled and still cold at Verandah.  The swimming pool at Crossroads was almost hot-tub temperature, whereas the jacuzzi there was scalding hot, so we just hung out in the pool. Met a nice couple in the pool and Mike and the gentleman chatted quite a while, while we ladies puttered around the pool.  
<p>
<b>Mon, 12/23/02</b><br>
We ran the breadmaker outside on my little roll-up aluminum table, and not having that heating up the interior was good too.  Within 90 seconds of taking the finished bread out, a huge wasp showed up, so I had to take it inside to cool.  Yeek.
<p>
Mike and I have started doing a mutual study session in the morning.  We had gotten pretty irregular in reading from Telushkin at night, and Mike asked if we could do it any other time besides just before bed.  So I made a deal that if we could do 15 minutes of assorted Talmud study in the morning over breakfast, I'd also do 15 minutes of study for my ham radio General class exam right afterwards.  This seems to be working out pretty well.
<p>
Mike has started taking bike rides around the resort-- a good place, since there's a lot to see and there's no real traffic
on the ring roads within the park.  A loop takes about 45 minutes at a moderate pace, which is great.  Longer if one stops
to chat with various interesting folks, like the guy who has a 1981 Bluebird diesel pusher schoolie that he
converted himself, over in the Verandah area.  Apparently it took him 17 months,
so we were right on track with the little short bus that we started on and had to 
donate to buy Birdie.  
<p>
<b>Sun, 12/21/02</b><br>
Cable modem installed, huzzah!  We put up the reflectix shades on the two large windows (bedroom and livingroom) facing southwest, since the temperature in the coach got up to 85 yesterday.  This seems to mitigate the temperature nicely, for both day and evening.
<p>
Now that Mike has his radio gear up and running, and the first of many antennas up, we can check in
on the various RV-related nets.  We monitored the FMCA net, and heard all the 
folks checking in and telling how much snow they'll be getting at their kids' places
for the holidays.  Grin.  (This might be Monday, but I don't recall.  Will try to 
update daily now that we're hooked up on the net for a while.)
<p>
<b>Fri, 12/20/02</b><br>
I can get a cable modem (so they tell me!) on a month-to-month basis, and it's much closer to a lot of attractions but still out of the middle of things.  So we just got settled in today, and I'm dialed in via the community center building.  Phew!  Now I have to get busy online, though not during Shabbos.  I still have two more reports to put out before Xmas!
