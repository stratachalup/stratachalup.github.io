a very nice retired couple in Texas.  They had named it "Berta II", after the lady's mother.  There is no name up on the front overhead plate, though, so we will be adding our name for it there: "Moby Bird".
<p>
It's big, it's (mostly) white, and we embarked for many months on what seemed a mad and fruitless quest to find and capture it!  A Bluebird? In our price range? Without many fatal flaws?  A wild 1800 mile ride to Dallas to inspect what seemed to be the best of the lot we had found, and then an even wilder 1800 mile ride back with our little car in tow behind our new Wanderlodge.  Moby Bird it is!  :-)
