<h3>Rambling Overview, now Outdated...</h3>
Good question!  Right now (March 9, 2002) we're concentrating on packing up the apartment and getting the heck out of Dodge.  I am making time to putter on the wiki only because Mike is up at<a href="RioVistaJunction.html">RioVistaJunction</a> today, workin' on the railroad.  :-)
<p>
If we were to put a 1 - 10 priority level on certain date.location tuples, they'd look like this:
<p>
<UL>
<li> 3-4  Mar 17 - 21, San Bernadino CA, Spring Escapade <b>missed that</b>
<UL>
<li> The annual conference of the full-timing group Escapees, <a href="http://www.escapees.com/"">http://www.escapees.com/</a>  A technical, social, and general fun event. We've gone up for the day to this in the past when it was in Chico CA, but this would be the first time we'd be going as full members of the community in our own rig.  But we have to get the apartment packed up or it will cost more than we want to spend to stay another couple weeks here in Sunnyvale.
</UL>
<li> 8-9  Mar 31, Sunnyvale CA, be Out of the Apartment <b>missed that, got out early May</b>
<UL>
<li> Even if we end up in someone's driveway for a few days, or in a campground, while we finish dealing with things in town like doctor's appointments, arranging the storage unit in a sane fashion, getting the old bus donated, storing the Ford Ranger, etc, we want to be out of the apartment and stop paying rent.
</UL>
<li> 5-6  May 17 - 19, Dayton OH, Annual Hamvention <b>surprisingly enough, we made it to the Hamvention! yow!</b>
<UL>
<li> The most enormous ham radio swapmeet in the known universe, 28K people amid acres of stuff, technical programs, etc.  Mike previously attended for the first and only time back in his college days in the mid-80's.  
</UL>
<li> 10  June 1, Warminster PA, my brother Kevin Rose's wedding <b>got in several days early, in fact</b>
<UL>
<li> The real "drop-dead" date here is we need to be in eastern PA in time for my brother's wedding.  Even the Dayton gig will be sacrificed for that, if necessary, since it's a Family Thing.  And Robyn is way cool, too.  :-)  Technically we need to be there a couple of days before June 1st to help with various misc.
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
So obviously there's a lot of leeway between March 31 and mid-May or June 1.  We are too busy packing to figure out what we want to do.  We could go across on 40, which should be warmed up enough to be easy to deal with by then.  If we noodle around northern CA a bit we could even go across on 66 or 70 and get to Dayton without any "hell rides".  We just don't know yet!
<p>
What about afterward?  Here are some things happening:
<p>
<UL>
<li> 10  early June, Long Island NY, Visit Mike's parents and his brother's family, as well as various other relatives.  <b>delayed until July, though we did get together in early June in Hoboken (long story, visiting Israeli relatives in town, everyone met in the middle)</b>
<UL>
<li> Expedition with the kiddlies and grandfolk to Steamtown USA and/or Rhinebeck Air Museum. <b>too far a trip with school, then camp, oh well</b>
</UL>
<li> 5-6 summertime, Upstate NY, Visit Mike's friends Steve & Jill and their family.  <b>Got up there for a weekend, not the week that we'd planned, Birdie down for repairs much longer than we planned.  Hoping to come by again in the fall.  Nice folks!</b>
<UL>
<li> Steve is an old ham radio buddy of Mike's, and one of his little girls is nicknamed "Fieldalia" since she was born around Field Day.  We'd need to schedule this more precisely, since their family travels quite a bit, but Mike would love to see them and they've invited us to stop by if we're in the area.  
<li> If we end up anywhere near Potsdam, there's a friend of Strata's to visit as well.  
<li> Also would love to see the various USDA facilities up around the Great Lakes area, such as the Apple reserve where hundreds of varietals are preserved and new varietals are planted, gathered from places like Eastern Europe or mountainous regions of China (both places where apples seem to have originated). <b>in the fall or not at all, alas</b>
<li> There is an annual or bi-annual Rose family reunion in upstate NY.  I don't know if it's happening this year or not.  Strata's Mom would love to go some year, but it's too far for her to drive by herself.  If that's happening this year, there's a chance we could have her fly in and meet her there. <b>July 7, and very very far north, so missed that, oh well...</b>
</UL>
<li> 7-8 late June, somewhere in western MA or upstate NY, Bait Con <b>made that, but tenting instead of motorhome due to repairs</b>
<UL>
<li> An annual family reunion of folks related by a set of mailing lists that go back to the early 1980's.  <a href="http://www.baitcon.org/"">http://www.baitcon.org/</a>  When Mike and I were getting even more serious, I brought him to Bait Con so the Tribe could check him out.  He clearly passed, as we got engaged on that trip.  ;-)
</UL>
<li> 6-7 summertime, central NH, Visit Strata's relatives and stroll down some memory lanes <b>keeping the fingers crossed</b>
<UL>
<li> See Strata's relatives in Penacook, in the Lake Winnisquam area.
<li> Try to connect with an old high school friend of Strata's, Bruce, who lives with his family somewhere in Central NH
<li> Stay at Bear Brook State Park, where many a family camping vacation was spent during Strata's youth
<li> Finally get a chance to visit the house in Chichester again, and (with permission from the current owners) take a walk around the property 
</UL>
<li> 7-8 summertime, Kennebunkport ME, Seashore Trolley Museum <b>a must do!</b>
<UL>
<li> Mike will complete a loop he began in early college by working (again) with his restoration mentor Donald Curry on historic trolley and interurban restoration at Seashore.  They have cheap RV hookups for member-volunteers, and are within an hour to hour and a half drive of some of my relatives in NH.
</UL>
<li> 10 Nov 3-8, Pennsylvania PA, LISA 2002 <b>ditto</b>
<UL>
<li> We could be in the area, having resettled.  We could be back in CA, and I would take Amtrak across again.  We could be down in Florida and I could take Amtrak up north.  No clue.  But I gotta be there, I'm on the program committee and I'm teaching a seminar again (Practical Project Management) unless I hear otherwise from Dan Klein.
