Yow, are we bored yet?  Surprise-- no!  And so far, I'm not tired of it yet-- things
still taste really good.
<p>
It's also really EASY to
eat Atkins-friendly by doing this, and all it takes is 
one big bowl and a fork, and sometimes a cutting board
and knife.  I have a habit of reading my email before I eat
anything in the morning, and if I run into something that urgently needs
fixing or replying to or whatever, I can often go until mid-afternoon
on only a cup of coffee.  
<p>
Being able to put together the salads easily and
quickly saves me from going out to the Indian Buffet place a half-mile away,
which used to be my default solution for "oh, I'm out of energy and need to
eat quickly".  The prewashed organic veggies are in the supermarkets now,
and while it might be a little cheaper to buy lettuce and shred it, I know
from experience that these last longer and are easier to deal with by far.
