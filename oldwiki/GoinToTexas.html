Leave Sunnyvale in early afternoon.  Arrive Blythe CA around midnight.

<b>Monday Feb 4</b>
"The Big Push"-- three states (not counting the one we started in) and two timezones (ditto).  Blythe CA to Peco TX.  Had dinner in Las Cruces NM, at what we hoped would be a good Mexican restaurant that instead was very lame, "Si Senor".  The one redeeming quality was the Golden Salsa, an amazing smooth yellow substance made primarily from smoked Hatch chilis.  I don't do chili peppers, being mostly allergic to them, but this stuff was so smooth and smoky and complex that I kept coming back to it.  Couldn't feel the center part of my tongue for about 24 hours afterward, oh well.  Great stuff.  Started taking Allegra again to damp my histamine system in case we ran into more of the same-- too good to pass up, even with collateral damage.

<b>Tuesday Feb 5</b><br>
Pecos TX to Dallas TX (Rockwall/Garland TX to be precise).  The last 100 - 150 miles were done in what turned out to be the heaviest snowfall in 28 years for that region.  Something about the Chalup weather curse acting up.  Alan, Mike's brother, had the NY blizzard for his wedding in the early 90's.  Settled into Best Western in Garland for what would turn out to be a longer stay than we planned.  20-20 hindsight-- should have stopped one exit back at the place that advertised weekly rates for suites.  Or should have reserved a week at the BW, they can't do it after the fact. At least we saved a few bucks a day with the AAA discount.  Tired, tired, tired, tired, but we got here in one piece!
