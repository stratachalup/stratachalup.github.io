<li> As Chris Rea says in his album "Road to Hell", <i>I said We're goin' to Texas, and she says What?!</i>  Strata still isn't flying (Dec 2000 and counting), and the idea of a "lifeboat" vehicle is a good idea when ferrying an older vehicle back across country.  So, we load a couple of hundred pounds of tools into the Toyota Echo and set out for Dallas to see the Bird.  It's the one which is most likely to work for us in terms of condition for the price we want to afford.  Mike has interviewed about a dozen owners with a detailed 60 - 90 minute questionnaire, and this looks like the best in our range.

<li> How we inspected, dejected, and generally non-rejected the Bird, finally getting on the road in rush hour after a completely gratuitously obnoxious day at U-Haul where a "no problem" job turns into an endurance ordeal.

<li> Now all we need to do is get back home before the cats give up on us, learn to run the coach along the way, and oh yeah, try to relax a little and maybe see a thing or two.  Texas to New Mexico, and a nice hotspring visit.

<li> It took DAYS to get out of Texas, climbing the 2% grade of the Permian basin.  After a nice rest at Faywood, we're on the way home!  We'll visit Tucson, Quartzsite, and some CA hotspring resorts on the way.
