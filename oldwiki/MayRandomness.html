<b>Mon, 05/12/03</b><br>
"Please use off ramps" said the polite little official road sign between I-10 and the frontage road.  The two were separated only by a couple of dozen feet of very slightly sloped gravel-- marked by several clear sets of tire tracks.  That got a laugh out loud, and was a good example of the kind of split-second lost photo opportunity that has characterized long distance highway travel for the past year.   We had wonderful wildflowers through the Texas hill country, of which I need to post pix if any of our through-the-windshield pix came out well.  
<p>
We're in El Paso TX, heading west on I-10 again tomorrow.  Today's "yet another little thing" is fixing 1 new large star crack in the windshield, courtesy of a rock truck yesterday, plus the 2 old small ones that never seemed important enough to fix.  Oh yeah, and getting a rebuilt governor for the air-brake compressor.  I really don't think we want to come down the Tehachapi without that, eh what?  We'll be stopping in Deming NM to visit Fayewood Hotsprings again (yay) and I hope taking a trip up to Silver City to visit a friend of mine.  
<p>
Outside of Beaumont TX we got VERY tired of driving through 100-degree heat and I insisted on finding an Onan shop to fix the breaker on our generator.  Lo and behold, there was a big RV service place a relatively short drive into the outskirts of Houston, and they set to work.  Guess what?! Another Bobarino!  Turns out that the replacement, underpowered, can barely run one AC generator (4.3kw instead of the 6.5kw original) was NEVER INSTALLED CORRECTLY!  To be fair, Mike says it was a very non-obvious, counter-intuitive botch.  Now we have a new breaker for the generator, AND a correct install and we can RUN BOTH AC'S AT FULL BLAST while running down the road.  Well.
<p>
I can hardly understate the difference that this makes.  We had SUCH a miserable time this past summer whenever we had to move the coach.  It would take hours to get it cooled down, and driving with the windows open blows things around, amplifies big-truck road noise, and leaves a fine layer of grit and/or dust over things.  Doing more than a 3 to 4 hour move was an exercise in endurance, as the cabin temps would go up to 95-plus.  I think having our new clock, which has temp and humidity info, was the last straw.  Now that I could *see* how hot things were getting, I couldn't stand it.  Plus I was getting more and more worried about the cats.  On a couple of move days, I had to wrap freezer packs in a damp dishcloth and lay them against the cats tummies as they sprawled out, trying to cool down.  
<p>
Now, we start the generator as we head out.  Running the front AC on close to full blast, in low cool (not even hi cool) will keep pace with the engine heat and keep the cabin at a comfortable 71 - 74 degrees.  There's never a miserable stage to overcome.  I run the little 120 volt heater in fan-only mode and point it under the couch where the cats sit, so that they get cool airflow too.  It's marvelous.  We put the auxiliary temperature sensor for the clock, the "outside temp" sensor, under the couch on the cats' bed-towel so we know how hot it gets there.  Recently we were shocked to see it was over 90 degrees, while the rest of the coach was cool during the move-- what was up?!  Oh.  One cat was laying on the sensor, the better to catch the cool breeze from the fan.  Silly beasties.  :-)
<p>
Birdie is back in "desert-mode" travel, meaning we get up no later than 7am and try to be on the move before 9am.  Doesn't always work, but hey, we try.  ;-)  All the reflectix window covers are out now, and we cover the windows during the day, first on the sunny side and then later on both sides.  Night-time around sunset, we turn off the AC's, fold back the reflectix, and open the screens.  One of us opens the windows a couple of inches, then pulls the screen across, and the other opens the glass part all the way from outside the coach.  This necessity that whelped this invention was Snark's realization that she could fling herself out the window in the 4 or 5 seconds it took to pull the screen across after opening the glass all the way.  :-(  Fortunately, she made this discovery back at Clerbrook during the winter, where we were in one familiar place and she knew how to get back to us again.  Several of the places we've stopped have the cats wild to go out, but it's just not safe.   In Pensacola, next to the swamps (aggalators), in Fort Stockton in the Chihuahua desert (coyotes, fast-driving local youth living near campground), and here in El Paso (a few hundred yards from I-10). They just don't understand why they shouldn't be allowed to do so.  I dearly hope we can get someplace fenced in and/or put up a kitty window-box when we get back to CA!
<p>
Gets nice and cold at night in the desert, so we can open the windows after dusk and give the kitties their "smellovision" to "watch".  When we go away from the RV for the day, we pull the curtains across the bedroom hallway and open the windows on either side a few inches.  That means that if (G-d forbid) anything were to happen to the RV, folks could rescue the cats, and it gives them another climate zone in case the power goes out during the day while we're gone.  They'd rather be overly warm and have smells than be cool and bored just looking out the window-- when we come back, we usually find them in the "hot" side of the coach, glued to the window or just lolling about.  As we say, "it's tough to be a puff!"

<h3>KOA New Orleans East, Slidell LA</h3>
<b>Tues, 05/06/03</b>
Tuesday we played traditional tourists, parking in the French Quarter and catching the St Charles streetcar line at its current starting point, canal and Carondelet.  Carondelet is known as Bourbon Street where it crosses into the French Quarter.  Let me digress and say that my opinion of Bourbon Street has not changed a whit since I visited in 2000 when the LISA conference was at the Marriot New Orleans.  It has all of the cultured appeal and charm of a spring break strip mall run by goth Ferengi.  <lj-cut text="Sacrilege! Laissez les bon temps roulez! Mais, quel dommage..."> Other parts of the French Quarter have chosen to preserve visual aspects of their history, such as the extraordinary ironwork of the upstairs galleries or the flickeringly quaint gas lamps.  Bourbon Street has apparently chosen to create an olfactory impression of history, harking back to the days of open sewers.  A potent miasma of human by-products (from both major orifices) blends with alcohol and horse manure to truly bring back the past-- a past that no one really *wants* to re-live.    Even the picturesque but fragrant mule carriages are merely an honest and earthy breeze compared to Bourbon Street.  Just hold your breath while crossing and you'll be fine.  The air clears within a block or so.
<p>
<h4>Ain't no *Trolley* named "Desire"...</h4>
The St Charles streetcar line ("don't dare call it a trolley", warns the brochure) began as a horsecar line sometime in the mid-1800's, and is the oldest continuously operated streetcar line in the world.  Formerly making a loop around much more of the city, most of it was torn out in 1964/65 as "antiquated" and replaced by buses.  Residents, such as the nice lady at one of the antique stores, were enraged, but could do nothing
about it.  Now, 40 years later, New Orleans is discovering what many other cities have discovered-- streetcar lines are good for renewing decaying downtowns, and probably should never have been ripped out in the first place.  The extensions to the line, possibly to run as a "new" line, should be ready sometime by the end of
this year.  It's amazing how much quieter the cars are when running on the so-called "neutral ground", the grassy median in the center of the street.  Our tour guide for the walking tour (more on this later) called it the "medium", and told us how it came to be known as neutral ground.  The first such area, long before horsecars or streetcars, was the middle strip down Canal Street.  This was literally neutral ground between 
the newcomer "les Americains" and the Creole/French/Spanish community in what les Americains contemptuously referred to as "the French Quarter".  Neither culture had cornered the market on arrogance, as we would hear in a number of tales, but the name stuck and all the median/medium strips became known as neutral ground.
<p>
I'll have to write up the Garden District tour later; left from a great little coffeeshop that reminded me of some places in Berkeley that I know, and was tons of fun, even in the heat and humidity.  The cemetaries are amazing.  It's scary to think about year and a day cremation in them, and the public "for rent" walls of tiny tombs.  One lady essentially saved the public cemetaries by creating a society.  Amazing to see the bent and warped inch-thick marble sheets on the mausoleum sides, crumbling after generations and flowing like ancient glass.  Whoa.
<p>
<h4>Tracking the wily #29...</h4>
Merely riding a historic trolley, excuse me, *streetcar* is, of course, only the tip of the iceberg for the true rail enthusiast.  One must not only minutely inspect the conveyances themselves, but also their entire operational environment, from the signals to the switches and from the overheads to the rails.  The trail
must be followed to the beasts' very lair, namely the car barn or switch yard from whence they are dispatched. After riding the line to the end, and then boarding a car going the opposite direction, we signaled for a stop where the curving rails went down a side street and followed the obvious tracks to the RTA, formerly NOPSI, Carrollton Street Car Barn.   We were looking for one car in particular, a work car used for track maintainance, and a relic of a previous era of streetcars: the Bacon & Davis work car #29, in service for the better part of 100 years.  Eureka!  There it was!  ;-)  Apparently the story of #29 is similar to that of SF MUNI's historic car #130, the one we chartered for our wedding party.  It was turned into a work car for a few generations and maintained, time passes, then at some point someone says, "oh, hey, this thing is way
historic, let's use it as a passenger car again."  
<p>
We asked permission to photograph from the closest available warm bodies, a couple of gentlemen wielding shovels outside the facility.   They said, "sure, we don't mind if y'all take pictures" and laughed among themselves with the crew of a work truck which was unloading by the door.  It was one of those "we know that you know that we know" moments-- they weren't the right folks to ask, they were just the folks who were sure 
to say yes. 
<p>
<h4>We've been kicked out of better carbarns than this, dude...</h4>
While Mike photographed the Bacon & Davis work car, I loitered in the somewhat dodgy neighborhood across the street.  I saw a pair of older
ladies emerge from one house, leading an adult dachsund and carrying a tiny dachsund puppy so small that it fit mostly in the palm of one lady's hand.  The puppy was emanating Cute Rays so fiercely that I absolutely *had* to strike up a conversation in the hopes of being able to pet the puppy.  Complimenting someone on their
cute doggy usually leads to being able to pet said doggy, and indeed, I was able to finagle a meeting with the little darling.  It had melting brown eyes and was incredibly soft, and licked my fingers with its little pink tongue.  Awwwww.   The ladies moved on, and I rejoined Mike, to walk around to the other side of the car barn, where who knew what additional wonders waited.  I exchanged eye blinks with a small surprised yard
cat, and admired the 15+ foot tall banana tree, complete with enormous cluster of green bananas, in another yard nearby.  I hadn't really been thinking of New Orleans as *tropical*, and it still didn't hit me until typing this travelogue.  Banana trees in a generic down-n-out neighborhood dirt yard-- yeah, that's tropical!   
<p>
Mike continued photographing, showing no signs of ennui, until the abrupt emergence of a tan-uniformed security guard who bellowed something largely incoherent but clearly meant to discourage.  Mike backed out of the car barn ("What? I was never in the car barn?  Well, maybe a little way, but I didn't really go *in*..."), 
apologizing, and we skedaddled.  The Bellowing Person was satisfied with our departure, and did not seek to give chase.  Later, in comparing notes on our day, Mike named getting chased out of the carbarn as his high point of the day.  Oh yah, I married a railfan.  
<p>
"At least it wasn't the Track Control Helicopter, like at the Long Island Railroad!"  
<p>
"Umm, yeah, honey, whatever you say.   Did I mention being glad that we met later in life?"
<p>
<h4>Judge not by its cover...</h4>
You will see amazing architecture if you ride St Charles line all the way out.  Too many types and styles to list.  Wow.  Should have gone out there to the Zoo, which is supposed to be one of the best in the US-- unbeknownst to me, revealed 
by a young 20-something couple on the streetcar, with whom I struck up a conversation because they were clutching a bright yellow copy of "New Orleans for Dummies".  As Dave Barry would say, I am not making this up.   They were on their way to the Zoo, via walking several blocks through the Garden District to admire even more historic houses.  I asked them what was the most surprising or valuable thing that they had learned from the "New Orleans for Dummies" book.  They replied that they had been too busy so far to really read it, but they hoped to look at it later after seeing the Zoo.  Words fail me.
<p>
Riding the waterfront line was not a biggie for me, but Mike enjoyed it.  ;-) 
<p>
<h4>We taunt the Evil Empire, but are carded at Harrah's...</h4>
Culture shock/blast from the past, as we encounter many dark-suited sales types and button-down oxford shirt engineering types from a big Microsoft developer conference at the convention center.  Whoa, I think, I used to live in this world a little bit.  Now these people look *really* alien to me.   I threaten to smack Mike if he follows through with his plain to loudly proclaim the virtues of Linux.  Later, however, 
I can't resist a remark of my own, loudly commenting that there might be hope for the technology industry.  Mike asks why I am saying that.  "Because a bunch of Microsoft developers just crossed the street on their own, against the light-- wow!  Maybe they'll break out of the herd mentality after all!" I think we got a glare, but I was busy not getting run over, so I'm not sure.  ;-)  
<p>
On the way back to the French Quarter, we decided that we desperately needed a dose of air conditioning to fortify us for the walk.  I vetoed the Riverwalk Mall as too sterile an environment (I hate malls, and get all claustrophobic in them).  We decided to cut through Harrah's Casino instead.  To my shock, I was asked for ID at the lobby.  Carded at Harrah's!  To paraphrase Arlo Guthrie, "I mean, I mean, I mean... *carded at
Harrah's*!" I guess I'll take it as a complement, and/or testament to scruffiness.  OK, I was windblown and overheated, and wearing a my Vintage Bluebird Amateur Mechanics baseball jersey with a heart on the front (my definition of happiness--  the bluebird, the moonlight, and you).  But I also turned 40 a few weeks ago, and the silver threads are definitely gaining on the gold.  "Vanity, vanity, all is vanity" as Kohelet (Ecclesiastes) says.  Carded at Harrah's-- that's a decent hunk-o-chevel.
<p>
<h4>Veni, vedi, mangez...yum!</h4>
Magnolia Cafe (200 Chartres) now called something else, menu looks similar, and good, but it's a breakfast and lunch place only, alas.  So we went to Olivier's (204 Decatur) instead and had a fantastic dinner.  OK, mostly fantastic-- I got a bit too daring with my entree, and found "Creole Rabbit" mostly not to my liking.  Should have
stuck with the corn-battered seafood sampler I had in 2000, or tried their duck breast with tart berry sauce.  I had duck the previous night at Tortorici's (441 Toulouse), which was unbeatable, but I have duck so seldom that I could easily have had it again, if not for feeling that would have been truly hedonistic.  Note to self-- I
have regretted NOT being hedonistic about an order of magnitude more times than I have actually been hedonistic enough to regret something more valid.  *Stop that.*  :-/
<p>
Home to puffs.  Tomorrow/today is a move day, and still with no AC-- local Onan gen places are clueless and/or we are.  Need to find a big RV place, point, and say "makee workee".
