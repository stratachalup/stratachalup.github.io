<h3>weekend wibblings (6/8/03)</h3>
<p>
We actually arrived On Time to our friend's wedding up in Bolinas.  This "on time" thing is new for me, as my old friends might remember.  I made it On Time to a dinner appt Friday with an old friend who now lives out of town.  I made it On Time to a lunch appt with an old friend with whom I'd lost touch on Wednesday, but 2 weeks early because I am a wuss and didn't read her email closely.  Doh.  At least I re-read the email *before* sending any kind of a note, even a polite one.  
<p>
The marine layer gave us plenty of cool-air cover, which was handy since it was a formal wedding.  I was glad that I had turned up the dial on my outfit, since we discovered that the bride's family is in the movie industry, and (I kid you not) we came back to our table after mingling to find that George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola were seated there.  I know you're thinking WHOA!!!  It's okay, it was VERY anti-climactic, they don't mingle much.  
<p>
The bride's Dad had done sound for Oscar-winning moviews of those two-- they have known her since she was a baby.  They basically held court at the table, chairs a half-turn away from the rest of us.  Mike & myself, and our friend (and my former employer) Rohit and his girlfriend talked tech and biotech amongst ourselves.  Very occasionally we would be permitted to join the changing conversations among George, Francis, Eleanor (Francis' wife, I think) and the empty chair that kept refilling with people.  
<p>
Several folks came up and made a point of introducing themselves, and talked about movies, and generally gave one or both of the guys the fan-boy (or fan-girl) treatment.  Their technique seemed to be to pretend to be hard of hearing if you said anything to them, and ignore you, unless you showed enough lack of social grace to basically get right in their face.  We didn't want to do that, so we just left 'em alone and tossed in a bon mot where it seemed appropriate.  After all, it WAS our table, and we were there first, nyah!  
<p>
I kinda wish that Rohit hadn't come up to me and told me about Lucas, else I would have made a point of introducing myself like I do whenever I'm at a wedding party table with strangers.  I have No Media Clue, so I would not have recognized him.  I only picked up that "Francis" was FFC because he attracted fanboys and because all the wine was FFC label.  That's when I put 2 and 2 together.   They had table cameras, and our group did the silly table cam thing where you take pix of the folks opposite you.  I politely insisted on dragging the other half of the table into it, as it's a wedding ritual and rituals are important.  So we have the dubious honor of having wedding guest pix taken by FFC and GL, though I suspect we'll never see 'em!  :-D 
<p>
I was going to go off to Corralitos to pick strawberries today, but I still have strawberries from the organic CSA, and we now have two half-pints of straw-blackberry jam from the table favors at the wedding.  Since one of my goals (perhaps the primary one) was to make jam, I figured I'd skip on it.   I need to make the final decision TODAY on whether to go back and audit the Massage 100 class on June 16 - 26. 
<p>
On the one hand, I really want to get back into massage, and without the immersive culture of the class, I might not be able to do it.  On the other hand, it's expensive, even at the half-price alumni rate, and then there's the lunch & dinner meals fee.  The catering is optional, but the class is so intense, and the food so good, that it's pretty disruptive NOT to do the catering option.  Like, you're smelling brownies baking during afternoon class and can't have any!  You're still on your own for breakfast, but since that's microwaved oatmeal almost every day for me, that's no problem.
<p>
It's really getting to be time to Jump Off the Cliff, as Mike puts it.  I don't want to go back to full-time high tech unless I have no choice, or it's only for a short time.  I still have the resources to take more time off as long as I keep expenses down.  I really, really, REALLY want to get something sustainable going with an alternative (to high-tech) lifestyle, even if it's living in the 'burbs somewhere and working at Home Depot.  Hey, I think it would be fun to work at Home Depot, they have cool stuff and you're doing something all the time instead of (as Carla, in War for the Oaks puts it) "sitting in a chair all day...and watching your butt get humungous."   Been there, done that, time to do something else!
<p>
<h3>schwing! (6/2/03)</h3>
That $5 Visor springboard module that I snagged at the hamfest is still selling online for $156. Not a bad deal! Now I know why that other guy grabbed all the others. 
<p>
If there's one lesson that one learns early at a hamfest, it's "never ask the price of something unless you are holding it/as many of it as you want". As soon as this dude heard the owner say $5, he literally snatched up the little crate with the rest of the shrinkwrapped modules. If I hadn't already picked mine out, I would have had to argue with him for whatever he planned to resell them for.
<p>
Conversely, the way you find out that you're asking WAY too little for something, as opposed to merely an attractively low price, is when somebody buys your entire box of stuff and proceeds to walk over to their own table and start laying it out. 
<p>
A few years ago Mike had a milk-crate's worth of power cords for sale. He was asking 25 cents each, just to get rid of them for sure and not have to drag 'em back. A guy started haggling with him for the whole box. In the meantime, another guy came up, snagged a cord, and tossed Mike a quarter. The first guy got indignant-- "Hey! That's my cord!" "I guess you'll have to bargain faster," said Mike. I think the guy bought the whole box for $5 or $10 and then proceeded to sell them at his table for 50 cents each. He was a regular, who hauled stuff back and forth every month (and probably to other hamfests as well). If he's willing to make the effort, he deserves the profit-- we were just cleaning house! :-D
<p>
<h3>Livermore Hamfest aka flea market fever (6/1/03)</h3>
<p>
Took our first trip in over a year to the Livermore ham radio flea market, first Sunday of the month at Las Positas College parking lot. Our new location in San Jose shaves about 5 miles and a number of traffic lights off the journey, so we actually got there only a few minutes after the 7am opening time.
<p>
We're still in "lighten the load" mode, so we weren't really shopping for stuff the way that we used to do. Heck, we still have unfinished projects that we've been carting parts around for the last year. But there were a few things, such as good o-ring sealable roof antenna mounts to replace the aging CB antenna mounts up on Birdie's forehead. I only spent $7, getting a real prize for $5 and a goodie for Mike for $2. 
<p>
The goodie for Mike was a set of Exceed 6.3 CD's with license key, good for Win 98/98/NT. I might do an install on my Win2K here and see if it flies, but I'm hoping to brainwipe this box and go to Linux real soon. I know, I keep saying that and it doesn't happen. Comes of not having the media slice, and no available machine from which to do a network install. And general wussitude, let's not forget that. :-D 
<p>
My great find for $5 was a new-in-box<a href="ThinModem.html">ThinModem</a> Plus, a 56K +V90 modem in Springboard module form factor. With the modem, the onboard color-capable browser, and my popper, and PalmOS SSH, I can do useful work over the phone with my Visor Prism. Yay me! Wish I had a Springboard 10/100 card for it, if there is such a thing, but hey. There was someone selling new/exc-cond with box Visor Edges for $50, who might have taken $40. I was tempted, but stuck to my budget. 
<p>
The guy's comment about the Edge was "They're selling for $80 on EBay", as if this should make my wallet leap out of my pants in haste. Dude! If they're selling for so much more on EBay, go sell 'em there. If you want to get cash in hand without worrying about online payments, shipping, and commission headaches, hand it over to me for less! For my part, if I care about whether or not it actually WORKS, I'll buy it from EBay and use an escrowed payment service so I can return it and get my money back. Who knows if I'll see YOU ever again?! 
<p>
The "I'm asking 80% of X, they're selling for X on EBay" sentiment was like some kind of geek chorus all throughout the hamfest. So, like, go there already and stop coming to hamfests! Sheesh. Guess I'm getting grouchy in my old age. Naah, I was always grouchy. :-) At least I didn't share my thoughts on the topic with any of the vendors. :-)
