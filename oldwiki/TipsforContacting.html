<li> Will I get a real letter back?  
<UL>
<li> No.  But one doesn't write letters to get a response, one writes letters to show that someone cares about an issue-- they rarely get as many as hundreds of letters on any single topic, and maybe dozens, at most, are obviously "real" letters rather than cut-n-pasted from some activist site.
<li> However, if you write, especially more than once a year or so, you will find yourself getting US Mail notifications about town meetings involving your rep, invitations to be part of a group meeting for a benefit dinner where you will have access to your rep, invitations to be part of a focus group meeting in your area, etc.  
<p>
</UL>
<li> If you want to be counted, make it easy to count.  This is especially important if you're responding to a last-minute plea from some group to oppose or support something coming to a vote-- the interns and staffers are going to be scanning the inbox and making hatchmarks on a piece of paper to hand to the rep at the last minute.  "This many support/oppose from your district, this many from your state, this many general input"
<UL>
<li> When you write, be sure to put your zip code in the subject line, along with "letter from constituent".  Your input  will count a LOT more if it comes from your rep's district, more than generic if from the rep's state.
<li> Also include the issue in the subject line, and your position on it you have space.  "Subject: (94086-5515) constituent letter: HR 12345: please oppose"
<li> Make sure you put your viewpoint *very* clearly in the first paragraph or so, and then add whatever long message you want. Some staffer will add you to the list they're keeping of for/against, and maybe (or maybe not) go on to read the full text later.  
<p>
</UL>
<li> Bonus points for including the Senate and/or House resolution number. Also include whatever popular name has been publicized on it.
<li> Double bonus for saying whether you want the rep to oppose or support the measure.  
<UL>
<li> Saying "I'm against clear-cutting" or "I'm in favor of keeping lumber jobs" is not necessarily enough info about whatever measure is on the table, which is probably full of compromises  anyway.  Let them know how you feel about the particular measure.
</UL>
<li> If there isn't a measure yet, or there should be a measure, let them know you are giving your viewpoint in advance: "I urge you to work toward creating (or limiting) reforms in education that would allow (or disallow) parents access to vouchers usable at private schools."
<li> If your rep has their own website and/or email addr, send there rather than to My_Rep@senate.us.gov or whatever.  The staffers go through that inbox at a higher priority than the other one, though both will get looked at.
<li> If you are involved in community action, or are a business owner, a teacher, a member of a particular religious or ethnic group, any kind of recognizable subgroup, make sure you include a .sig (if your note is short) or mention of that group in your top section.  This kind of thing is counted and measured by the staffers as well.  "Dear blah blah,  As a fireman/schoolteacher/small business owner in your district..."
<li> Choose the type of letter.  In order from "counts the most" to "counts the least":
<UL>
<li> Hand-written paper original letter
<li> Typed/printed paper original letter
<li> Faxed original letter
<li> Emailed original letter
<li> All typed, faxed, or printed obvious form letters
<li> Forwarded petitions with your signature
<li> It's much easier for me to use a template and email rather than go to their silly web forms, and my reps happen to allow the email input and not insist on the web forms, so that's what I do.
