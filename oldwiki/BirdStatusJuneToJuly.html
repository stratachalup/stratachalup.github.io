<p>
It was a tough ride up here, on one of the hottest, most humid days of 
the summer, and I'm surprised we made it without incident.  The new
radiator makes all the difference.  We made our traffic window for the
run up 95, departing Long Island at 11:06am and only hitting a few
jam-ups on the Long Island Expressway.  Several bouts of stop-n-go
for the eternal construction projects on 95, but nothing too bad.
We arrived at Strawberry Patch around 4pm, into a shady site with
enough juice to run both our AC's at full blast.  That really makes
a huge difference when cooling down a huge block V8 and the associated
steel structures around it!
<p>
Tuesday we visited Mystic Aquarium-- very impressive!  Everything is
squeaky clean, and the critters in the exhibits are in great shape.  Of
particular interest to me were the seahorse exhibits.  I've never seen
such lively seahorses.  The best tank turned out to be juveniles raised
as part of the aquarium's breeding program.  They were frolicing with
each other, cutting all sorts of capers and acrobatics.  I also saw some
four-day-old seahorses on the Behind the Scenes tour-- about a half inch
long, looking like pieces of detritus until they jump.  My camera chose
that time to malfunction with battery problems, a side effect of using
the LCD panel so much to line up shots through tank walls.  Since I can't
use the viewfinder with the 37mm+10 "macro" add-on lens, I couldn't line
up a shot of them even though I had enough glass to get one.  Argh!!! Oh
well.
<p>
The Behind the Scenes tour, at $6 per person, was a great bargain.  We saw
the quarantine tanks, the feeding supply area, all sorts of filters and 
cleaners and water quality monitoring equipment, etc.  Mike had a great time
taking in all of the neat equipment and techniques developed since he 
worked in a marine lab a couple of decades ago.  A burrette and pipette
stand in one lab still stood as a reminder that the boring stuff never goes
away.  :-)  Unlike the excellent Behind the Scenes tour, the "Beluga Contact 
Program" turned out to be a disappointing chance to shell out $110 per person 
to slosh around in borrowed waders and pet a beluga whale on the nose.  
Not that I wouldn't have been thrilled, but I just couldn't see paying that 
kind of money, especially when we're both on sabbatical.
Mike noted the 100+ foot visibility in the sparkling beluga tank.
He'd happily pay $110 to jump in there with his drysuit and get some
awesome pictures.  No such luck!  
<p>
Their Challenge of the Deep exhibit is pretty interesting, with a lot of
material from Bob Ballard's expeditions in search of Roman/Biblical era
shipwrecks in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.  There are also some
good interactive kiosks demonstrating side-scan sonar vs video, and a little
model submersible chamber that non-claustrophobes can climb down into.  The 
submersible chamber has a video and phone link.  Alas, the phone was barely
payphone-quality in construction and was already thoroughly broken, even
though the exhibit just opened this summer.  The Jason ROV and the Navy's
Turtle submersible are both on display outside the exhibit.  Beyond some
buoys is a little boatyard with radio-controlled boats run by coin kiosks,
a cute idea that kept a lot of kids entertained.  
<p>
Wednesday & Thursday were spent primarily at Mystic Seaport, with many 
exhibits and "living history" demonstrations.  Did you know that you can 
get your ticket validated for a 2nd day if you ask?  Neither did we, but 
we were pleased to find out, and enjoyed two days for the price of one.  
We also brought a picnic lunch for the second day, since we found that 
$2 cans of Coke and $7 sandwiches were the norm at the refreshment stands.  
Yikes.  
<p>
Strata particularly enjoyed the Cooper (barrelmaker), the ship-building
exhibits showing the joinery and specialized construction techniques, the
evolution of the catboat, the gallery of small regional sloops, and the
figurehead museum (no demos or details on carving, alas, just the pieces).
Mike's favorites were the blacksmith shop, marine instrument maker, the 
gallery exhibits, and of course the Charles W Morgan square-rigged whaling ship.  
We both really enjoyed the planetarium show on identifying summer constellations in 
the<a href="NorthEast.html">NorthEast</a>, doubly so when we asked some questions afterwards and ended up 
with a private showing of later evening stars and of Southern Hemisphere
constellations-- the latter which Mike has seen in person but Strata has not.
We were quite enthralled also by a demonstration of knots and rope
techniques given on the Morgan, particularly the very clever yet simple
steps to do the elegant-looking rope lashing on guardrails.  It's just a
series of alternating half-hitches, but looks mighty fine!  The high point
of the visit was a brief sail on a wonderful little sloop run by the
volunteers at the boat shop.  It's the best bargain on the place, a
half-hour sail for $4 per person.  We had admired the little catboat
sloop maneuvering around the harbor, turning on a dime around buoys and
other boat traffic.  When we found that it belonged to the boat shop,
and was "charterable" for regular sails, we signed right up!

<h3>Saturday July 27, 2002: Battle Row Campground, Long Island NY</h3>
<p>
We're just finishing up a nice couple of weeks visiting with Mike's family and getting to know our niece and nephews a bit better.  We've done several family outings, including today's visit to the Long Island Aquarium. It's so cute to see Mike surrounded by little voices all yelling "Mike Mike Mike!"
and "Look, Uncle Mike, look! Uncle Mike!!!" Carrie and I go after him with
"MikeMikeMikeMike" too, just to be difficult, and he looks like he's in the
middle of a riot.  Which is a good description of a house with 3 kids ages 1.5,
5, and 8.  :-)
<p>
The<a href="BethPage.html">BethPage</a> Restoration village was a bit disappointing if you are more 
interested in how people lived in the 1800's rather than the appearance of their houses
full of furniture.  It opened in 1970, and while it has had financial issues, I
felt that they could have had more in the way of signs or interpretive information.
Going on a weekday certainly didn't show it to its best, but notwithstanding that
I definitely felt let down.  Mike assures me that Sturbridge Village or Old Mystic
Seaport are on a more interesting scale and that I will enjoy them.  
<p>
Adventureland turned out to have the same train ride that Mike had ridden as
a kid, but most of the rest of the park had changed.  We rode the carousel,
the train ride, and then something called "Music Express" that I should have
watched go through a FULL CYCLE before riding.  Let's just say it got faster
than I thought it would.  Yeek.
<p>
Speaking of adventures, we lost our awning in a micro-monsoon that blew through
the Long Island area on Monday the 22nd.  We came back to the coach late in the
evening, after dinner and a visit with Mike's brother and his family.  The awning
bar was in a V shape and the awning hanging down over most of the side of the 
coach.  We should have left it set up on a slant instead of straight, and
then we wouldn't have had a problem.  Some nice neighbors were watching for our
return, and came to help us hoist the heavy soaked awning up onto the roof so that
we could get inside our coach!  Mike secured it to the roof and we retired, not too
happy.  We found out later that we were all very lucky.  During the process of taking
the awning roller off the support arms, the internal spring came unwound-- Mike heard
it racheting inside the roller bar.  The nice lady at<a href="ZipDee.html">ZipDee</a> told us the next day that
most of the time when that spring comes unwound, somebody goes to the Emergency Room.
It has the same amount of force as a garage-door spring, and they use special bolts on
awning arm heads that can take 4000 pounds of force.  Oh.  Gulp!!
<p>
As you can imagine, the mornings of Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday were
largely spent making phone calls and dealing with the awning issue.  Our insurance,
Foremost, will cover replacing it, but we discovered that our policy was for "Actual
Cash Value" instead of full replacement.  This means they cover labor and shipping of
parts at 100 percent, but parts at only 50 percent.  Ouch.  Another few hundred dollars
into the money pit, but at least we'll have a new awning.  When we cut the old one down
on Thursday afternoon, we had planned to try to save some of the Acrilyan canvas and offer it to
anyone who had the old 70's Wanderlodge cream-and-gold paint scheme.  We discovered that
the canvas was pretty much shot-- it cut like paper, and in many cases tore when minimal
force was applied.  Considering that it was 27 years old, and that<a href="ZipDee.html">ZipDee</a> says the life
is 15 - 20 years, it wasn't worth patching or re-using, so we ended up throwing it out.
<p>
Anything can happen while RVing, and usually does.  Mike saw some folks yesterday
painting the grass green down at the end of the row.  It turns out that a commercial
was going to be filmed onsite today.  Sure enough, when we woke up early this morning
there were several rental RVs, kleig lights, extras playing frisbee, huge camera stands,
and about 100 people swarming around as part of the process.  They were using a gas grill
for keeping charcoal smoking photogenically, as well as having nicely painted green grass.
I'm sure there were other "more real than real life" tricks at work.  The late-80's style
Winnebagos they were using for the commercial campers were generic but nice, and we joked
about having them rent something distinctive, like ours, for several hundred dollars a day
(extra for the cats!).  :-)
<p>
Next week it's on to Connecticut, to tour Old Mystic Seaport, the nuclear sub museum,
the New England Aquarium, and various other local attractions.  We'll be at Strawberry Hill
campground for several days, then on to the Boston area for a week and a half or so.  We're
scheduled to get our awning replaced on August 14 in Berkeley MA.
<p>
<h3>Friday July 12, 2002: Quakerwoods Campground, Quakertown PA</h3>
<p>
Well, we haven't been getting online regularly-- moved to Tohickon Family Campground in Quakertown a few days before July 4th, then moved from there to Quakerwoods Campground and are still there.  Moving to Long Island to visit Mike's folks as of Monday July 15th.
