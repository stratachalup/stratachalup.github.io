Back in February, a tortoise came to visit our campsite, accepting our adulation, accolades, and a small handout (a bit of apple, of course).
<p>
Today, while on the phone in his usual seat, Mike noticed a turtle crossing the campsite. Unlike the tortoise, who made a beeline for our door, the turtle was just passing through obliquely. Some folks have been brushcutting in the pasture on the other side of the trees, including some small trees themselves. This might have been disturbing to a turtle, but we aren't aware of any water source over in that area. 
<p>
We gave him or her a lift over to the main pond-y area. I haven't handled turtles in a very long time, but remembered to hold the turtle well away from my body and not right over my feet. This proved to be a good thing, avoiding the "turtle water" copiously produced, or leaking from areas better left unimagined, or both. Eeewww. 
<p>
Mike, wise in the ways of many things, but not necessarily turtles, kept asking, "shouldn't we take him over here where the bank is less steep?" Since that area looked like a nice place to sink into mud up to the ankles on the wa to the shore, I said "No, this will be fine.". I set the turtle down a couple of feet from the water, at the top of a roughly 45-degree grassy slope. After ascertaining that we weren't in sight (we were, but behind and to the side), the turtle went from 0 to Zoom and leaped into the water, swimming down and out of sight. "Wow!!!" said Mike. "Yep. They jump."
<p>
I've sat here for many hours on the computer, and who knows how many turtles and tortoises I've missed. Location, location, location. Where I sit, I mostly see the treeline. That's great for birds, though, treating me to frequent views of meadowlarks, bluejays, cardinals, and some less identifiable birds. There's definitely a seasonality here-- the little vireos that hopped all over the grass at dusk in December, and the nuthatches in the trees in January have moved on. During December and January, the sandhill cranes were everywhere, and one could hardly take a walk around the park without seeing several pairs foraging, dancing, or just making their loud yawps and shrills. One or two great blue herons would usually be around the local pond or out on the micro-pond by Verandah. Snowy egrets and cattle egrets became commonplace in mid January, ubiquitous in late January, and occasional in February. Here in mid to late March, the waterfowl of the hour seems to be a small white ibis, and its many relatives, seen stalking around the greens with their ridiculously red corrugated feet, sometime accompanied by a coot or two. Snorkeling in Silver Glen Springs a couple of weekends ago, I got to accompany a coot underwater for a while. It was a much better free diver than myself, no surprise!
<p>
During the foggy, froggy evenings of the first real warm moist weather, frogs and toads seemed everywhere. Tiny peeper-like frogs clung to the window squares of the clubhouse door, taking advantage of the bugs attracted by the lighting from within. Several sizes of toads were around the pools, especially during the Night of the Crickets, who must all have woken up at once. Going to the water fountain before swimming one night, a small frog looked up at me with golden ringed eyes, nonchalantly sitting in the drain. He seemed to appreciate the additional water as I took a drink. 
<p>
"Florida! Florida's nothing but bugs and snakes!" My mother-in-law's Florida is waking up, and it's time for us to leave. Dragonflies big enough to pick up mouse pups are a source of delight, but rumors of palmetto bugs make me eager to be rolling on. As of this past week, to paraphrase some dead patriot (Thomas Paine, I think), "the price of an ant-free kitchen is constant vigilance". Tomorrow we're driving down to the Florida Keys for a few days, putting Les Poofs in storage with the friendly local cat-only vet clinic. I think I'm going to take everything off the counters and wash them down with a strong saline solution. I really, really, really don't want to find a few zillion ants enjoying Spring Break on my countertop when I get home. 
<p>
After we're back on March 31st, we'll get the routine maintainance done in our April 1 garage visit. Once we're sure the greasy part is over, we have an appointment with the local flooring folks to get this done-for carpet ripped out and replaced with a nice quasi-indestructible tile flooring. After that, 6 new tires (sigh) and possibly new rims, as its only $58/wheel to switch to trucking-standard Budd 10-hole 7.5 or 8.25 rims. Then we can use 11R x 22.5 tires, the choice of just about every trucker on the road, instead of our hard-to-find 10R x 20's. Fortuitously, the 11R's have (ta dah!) the same rolling radius as our current tires, so no tedious speedometer mods are required. Double yay. 
<p>
Sure, it would be nice to put a good set of used Alcoa rims on, like a lot of the other Wanderlodge crowd, but at $200/wheel, it just ain't happening right now. The best part of the switch is that the 11R's are a tubeless tire, giving you some hope in hell if you pick up a nail unlike the tube'd 10R's. Less road heat, and, since tubeless, you can drop in Equal and let the wheels self-balance instead of worrying about dropping a weight. Sure, you can dyamically balance any tire, but then it's set in stone until you pull it off the next time. On the fly real-time dynamic balancing is the way to go-- or so say all the pro drivers on the group. Anyway. After the tires, Birdie's nose points back to California!
<p>
Almost forgot to mention the awesomely nifty Campagna T-Rex cycle cars that we saw outside one of the local permanent flea markets. The owners were Quebecois, and were down for Bike Week at Daytona. They trailered them down here, understandable due to the horrendous weather between here and there. Truly covetously awesome little mach-eens, and they looked like a heck of a lot of fun to drive when they pulled in.  Look in the March 2003 photo dir under (surprise!) "Cycle-Cars".

Last weekend Mike was doing the ARRL DX Phone contest, and made about 210 contacts, working sites from Europe to Japan and all over in between.  The band was hot!  He just got his participation pin from the contest he worked back in the fall, when we stopped at Pedro's Campground in South of the Border SC.  If he keeps this up, his hat will be full.  :-)
<p>
It was a largely unexciting week, which I spent mostly working.  I got two report final candidates out, and one of those is a 2nd round edit that will probably go to the field.  Three to go, and I've got templates in place for them already.  Pant, pant.  
<p>
Mike made it to the local ham radio lunch group this Tuesday and had a nice time, meeting a fulltiming RV couple who'd joined the group that week.  I'd really like to make it to lunch this coming week, so I'll try to get my work schedule in sync for making that.  The real problem is that since the site is about 40 minutes away, and close to some places where we run errands, Mike usually does an afternoon of stuff afterward, and that cuts into the workday.  I should just shift my workday on Tuesdays, but I'm trying to stay disciplined about these things. 
<p>
Mike was supposed to go diving on Wednesday, but it was a moderately challenging guided cavern dive and he'd had some equipment problems on a dive last week.  I was very relieved that he cancelled, and committed to doing a swimming pool test dive to work out the wrinkles first.  Thursday was my follow-up with the endocrinologist, and in order to keep working with her, I need to see her again in about 3 weeks.  We also need to do some mechanical work on Birdie, a standard lube and such, so we decided to extend the campground stay until the end of March.  I'll get the contract done in the next week or so, and then we can put the cats in storage for a few days at the vets (sorry, buddies) and go down to see his Aunt Rhoda in Palm Beach, and go see the Keys for a couple of days.  Travelling light in the Echo will be easier and more affordable than moving Birdie down there-- between gas and campground fees, it's just as cheap to stay in cheaper hotels and get 40mpg (and the security of a well-functioning car) with the Echo!
<p>
<b>Sun, 03/02/03</b><br>
The weather got better for a week or so, and is now back to the stormy muggies.  Mike has been seeing palmetto bugs outside.  I am so not enthused about this development.  At least we are not seeing them inside.
<p>
What have we been doing for the last 2 weeks?  Umm, let's see, I do mark the calendar occasionally.  I've mostly been working.  We've had some medical appts.  Mike has gone diving a couple of times, most recently on his birthday Feb 26.  I made him a cake, but didn't take a picture of it-- chocolate cake in the mini-heart pan, with a red rose candy on top (made from Wilton candy melts with my candy molds), creamcheese frosting, and red edible sparkle decoration.  
<p>
We both went to the Rainbow River last week on the 22nd with Captain Don and had a good time.  I snorkeled again, and Mike dove with Don.  I wanted to shoot some video, but Don mostly did the video.  Too bad, I really wanted to go chase some fishes.
<p>
The ugly weather last weekend kept us indoors, instead of going to the Florida Flywheeler's antique car meet, or the big RV show in Deland, or the Cocoa Beach Mardi Gras celebration. Bleah.
<p>
Mike has gone a couple times (or maybe only once?) to a lunch group that the local QRP radio group does on Tuesdays.  We were going to go together last Tuesday, but getting blood drawn at Lab Corp in Clermont took three kinds of forever and we didn't make it in time.  Sigh.  I have a follow-up with the endocrinologist this coming week, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
<p>
I've gotten to the end of my rope with the coach, since we've been spending so much time indoors.  In fact, someone on the Wanderlodge list said, "You might be spending too much time in the coach.  Possibly it would be better to spend more quality time out side under the awning."
<p>
He's right, but that will work better when it isn't 80+ percent humidity and 85 degrees and biting insects out under the awning.  Which is currently rolled up due to possible gusts of up to 35mph.  Sigh.  
<p>
I think what we need to do is rent a park model somewhere for a 
month, move all our stuff out of Birdie, and just go at it--
<p>
<UL>
<li> strip carpet and redo floor, 
<li> TSP and then SEM-paint all the bins and the yellowing vinyl edgings, 
<li> use soft buffing wheels on all the aluminum window edgings 	(inside and out), 
<li> glue a half-dozen or so pieces of trim into place, 
<li> rig some patching for places where we don't have a replacement, 
<li> pull and replace dozens of rusting non-stainless screws, 
<li> remove and clean the icemaker gasket,
<li> rig a little 12v fan to ventilate the icemaker area into the 	bathroom undercounter area,
<li> finally put edging on the table we built,
<li> pull the front panels out to string all Mike's antenna lines 	that currently go through the passenger window
<li> restore the front speaker volume knob to functionality where the previous owner had a stereo installed & they didn't wire it right
<li> pull off the back volume knob and clean the pot & contacts
<li> wire up a mini-stereo-plug interface to the speakers so I can ditch the silly little computer speakers I use for mp3 playing
<li> rig covers for the top of the dinette seats and front seats to cover the worn spots (pre-dates us), and the cat punctures (doh)
<li> repaint/replace the battered heater grilles
<li> roof painting (argh, huge job)
<li> touch-up-painting on exterior to cover flake-away bits (worth the trouble? we can't afford repainting anytime soon)
<li> try to pry up the glued-down hinges of the screen door, without breaking them or the door, and find/build a replacement 	screen door ("oh, this model never had a screen door!" 	said the prior owner.)
<li> restore to some vague grace the abomination that is the remains of the folding door track in the back, removed and hacked up by prior owner
<li> get replacement for pull-down shade in front windshield windows, as material ripped this winter along one side
<li> oh, there's more. there's *always* more.  
<p>
</UL>
Maybe we could get by with boarding the cats for a month and 
buying a cheap (but watertight) tent, then find a bunch of huge 
Rubbermaid snap-tight bins onsale at Super-K or Wal-Mart, to 
chuck stuff into to get it out of the coach.  We are smart enough
(mostly) to work around wet paint, glue fumes, sharp tools, etc
but the cats have little walnut brains and insatiable curiosity
that seems to override any survival instinct.  
<p>
Studies actually show that domestic cats are a separate species, and have 2 main differences from wild cat stock: they are social, and form colonies or groups even when feral, and their brains are noticeably smaller. I am not making this up.
<p>
Anyway.
