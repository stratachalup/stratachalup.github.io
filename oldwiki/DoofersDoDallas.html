Day 1 of coach inspection.  Mike did the underbody inspection using the Williams' creeper, and I did the appliances and interior.  Scary test drive on the frontage roads nearby-- they don't call these things a Wanderlodge for nothing!  We decide that the steering needs tightening, though Bob feels that it is just the way the coach handles.  Mike is also not happy with the braking, and wonders if the shoes need adjustment.  We arrange to take it by his mechanic's shop and see if anything can be done, although Bob doesn't think it's necessary.   
<p>
We trust Bob, but have had first-hand experience with "driver drift".  Strata had a car many years ago that she didn't know needed major brake work until she loaned it to a friend.  He returned it, safe and sound but still in shock from the scare he'd had driving it.  People gradually adjust their driving style as a vehicle wears, and she'd learned to stop extra early without thinking about it.  Mike also wants to talk to the mechanic about the coach history and what might need doing if we were to buy it and head off to CA.  It's 1900 miles, and that's a long shakedown cruise!  
<p>
Had lunch with the Williams' at a great little BBQ place in the pharmacy / convenience store / krispy kreme outlet / gas station at the Rockwall exit.   Dinner with them at a nearby Italian place that was really good.  Bob used to be a Chief Petty Officer, and then got into project management.  Chatted about a lot of things!
<p>
<b>Thurs Feb 7</b><br>
Day 2 of coach inspection.  On day 1, we began constructing a list of things that need doing, and their priority.  It is dauntingly long, but few things are integral to the operation of the coach.  Our main concerns are the steering and braking, since if they cannot be altered, we don't feel comfortable driving the coach.  If they are just out of whack, then it becomes a matter of price point comfort as to whether we would buy it.  We phone our insurance agent and let him know that we may be buying the coach tomorrow, and would need to either transfer our existing policy from the bus project in storage, or get a new policy.  He agrees to have things ready if we do it, and will issue us a proof of insurance via fax for the drive home.
<p>
Vist James Jackson of Jackson Automotive.  James takes a test drive.  Mike and James do creeperfest underneath the Bird, tightening up a little leak here and there, bleeding the air chambers (no water/junk, good!), and James tightens up the power steering, much to the amazement of Bob.  The adjustment is easy, and there is a more complex adjustment that could be done if this one weren't sufficient.
<p>
James also adjusts the brakes, which were definitely due for it, all four of them.  He shows Mike the procedure, which involves screwing the shoes down until they touch, then backing off a half-inch.  No problem, says Mike.  The front brakes are at 70% or more, quite respectable.  The rear brakes are at 30%, which will get us home and beyond but ought to be dealt with in the next 5K miles or so.  We take the coach out again, and the difference is quite noticeable, for the better.
<p>
Mike and I confer and decide to buy the coach.  We come to an arrangement with the Williams, and will do the transaction tomorrow, since the banks are closed.   We go out to Cajun Catfish, a yummy local place, with the Williams, and celebrate our entry into the world of RVing by going dutch this time.  ;-)
<p>
<b>Fri Feb 8</b><br>
Stop by the hotel office to extend (again!), and make sure we can bring the Bird back to the parking lot here.  No problem!  They ask us to move rooms, though, since a big student conference is coming into town and the room we're in has a pull-out couch, reserved by one of the mobs of students room-sharing.  Also no problem.
<p>
We visit the bank with Bob and get a cashier's check cut for him.  Fortunately our bank in CA has eaten or been eaten by enough other banks that it has spread across much of the country, and we are able to go to a local office of it in Rockwall TX.  We will find later that the assimilated bank is on a different computer system from ours in CA, which means we can't access linked accounts from an ATM machine.  This doesn't inconvenience us on this trip, but is good to know about.  Fortunately we can do transfers from the interest-bearing account to the general ATM card account over the phone if we need to do so.
<p>
Back at the Williams', we do up a bill of sale and get everything faxed off to our insurance guy.  If you live in CA, especially in the SF Bay Area, and need an agent, you should talk to ours!  Shlomo Vilozny (831 685 8228) is a Farmer's agent, but can write independent policies as well.  His kids are helping him with the business, and it's a real old-fashioned family type business.  They're over in Aptos, near Santa Cruz.  I used to live in Santa Cruz, and then kept Shlomo as an agent when I moved back over to Sunnyvale.  How many insurance agents do you know who will play fax tag with you to get a liability policy in place to ferry an out of state vehicle back home?   
<p>
All the excitement, and driving, and rummaging around the Bird, of the last few days has worn us out completely.  The Williams' agree to let us pick up the Bird tomorrow and just quit early today!  We head off at 4pm or so, get BBQ takeout for me from the place near the exit, and then get Chinese takeout for us both at around 9pm.  We actually have a quiet evening at the hotel, hanging out watching bad TV (Banzai Friday movie night) and relaxing.  Amazing!
<p>
<b>Sat Feb 9</b><br>
Even more amazing, we sleep in and catch up on sleep a little.  Wow!  Then we have a leisurely lunch at Cajun Catfish, which we liked so much that we wanted to go back, then head over to the Williams'.  We pick up the Bird and head over to Best Western.  We literally get about two blocks from the Williams' and Mike radios me from the Toyota Echo-- "Water is pouring out of the coach!!"  Argh.  
<p>
I find a place to pull over and we take a look, pulling up the bed in back and finding water sloshing around in the compartments underneath.  It turns out that either Bob or myself had not tightened down the inspection hatches that he had installed in the top of the freshwater tank under the bed.  When I tested the brakes, hard, at the end of his block, water had sloshed up and out of the loose port(s).  Doh.  This begins a tradition that we will come to refer to as "Scare of the Day".
<p>
The rest of the trip back to the hotel is uneventful, and we park the bus where they asked us to park it on the side lot.  Huzzah.  Now for dinner and lots of laundry, as well as catching up on email via a local Earthlink dialup.
<p>
<b>Sun Feb 10</b><br>
Off to Camping World, to join their emergency road care program, since AAA can't/won't do motorhomes.  We definitely want that in place before we head back West.  We also join Passport America, an RV savings club that gives discounts on park stays.  It's cheap, less than $40/year, and pays for itself if you stay 3 or 4 nights at parks that do the discount.  We buy a bunch of stuff we need for the rig, but are stymied in our search for a towing rig to tow the Echo home.  We look at the models they have there, which are in stock, but find that the brackets that mount onto the car are a special order.  Two weeks!  No way!  
<p>
On the way home, we follow the RV tradition of stopping in at Wal-Mart and getting things we probably could have done without. :-)
<p>
The concept of caravanning home with both of us driving is not particularly acceptable either, so we return to the hotel and start mining the yellow pages.  As an email I sent that night indicates, nobody has them in stock and everybody says it's a long wait for them.
<p>
<i>Waiting for more laundry to dry and watching laughably bad TV.  At 7am [fear] we need to call U-Haul and see if *they* can get a Roadmaster towing bracket for a 2001 Toyota Echo sometime before the next millenium, unlike Camping World, 4 Seasons RV, etc, etc ad nauseum.  
<p>
"Toyota Echo? What's that?"
<p>
If we'd driven the Ranger out here, they could have pulled the 
razza-frazzin-snazza-frazzin brackets off the shelf, but we are
in the land of pickup trucks and SUV's. 
<p>
And really good BBQ.  So that's ok.  ;-)</i>
<p>
<b>Mon Feb 11</b><br>
A day of errands, and trying to find a place that can get us the heck out of Dallas in one piece, Bird plus Echo, sooner than the end of the week!  U-Haul claims they can get the part, but the soonest they can work us in is Tuesday afternoon.  Argh.  It's still sooner than anyone else can get it.  They have the advantage of a regional warehouse relationship with Roadmaster, unlike the other RV places we called.  
<p>
We go to PEP Boys to get misc things we need, we go to a locksmith to get new cylinders for the Bird bay doors, as it turned out Bob didn't have keys for them.  We also put cylinders on the gas door and the battery door.  
<p>
<b>Tues Feb 12</b><br>
The good news is that U-Haul can take us a couple hours early, so we check out of the hotel (brief sticker shock).  The bad news is that the work goes on...and on...and on.  Clearly they have not put one of these things on an Echo before.  They are wielding large machine tools and drilling places which should already line up.  We are Concerned.
<p>
We try to wait patiently, and entertain ourselves by checking and topping off the tires on the Bird.  A good thing we did, since the driver's side front was down 40 pounds from where it should have been at 100.  Since it was brisk and crispy in Dallas and we knew we'd be heading home to hotter climes, we kept things 3 -5 pounds low.  The other tires were down 10 - 15 pounds from where we wanted them, except for one rear dually which we couldn't access.  It seems that during the last tire rotation, the shop put this tire on one lug-nut forward of the other, so the valve stem comes out behind steel instead of behind a hole in the rim.  Wups.  
<p>
Given that it's a job and a half to pull the tire, this will wait for fixing until we have the brake work done later.  Fun for everyone trying to bring the front tires up beyond 85. The compressor at the U-Haul is only rated for 100, which is fine, but every time someone hits an air tool in the shop for more than 2 seconds, it drops to around 85.  Since we don't have anything better to do, we wank around with it and finally get things the way we want them.  Brought the fronts up to 94/100 and the rear ones, except for the black sheep dually, to 72/75 from 55 - 60.
<p>
Eventually we intervene increasingly frequently with the mechanics working on the Echo, and the manager gets involved helping them figure out what to do.  If they'd done that 3 hours ago, we'd all have been better off, oh well.  The mechanic didn't want to break for lunch until he finished, so he was going hypoglycemic, literally, during the last part of the install.  Aieee!
<p>
They rig us up with the dorkiest set of safety chains we've ever seen, since they cut them too short at first, forgetting that the hitch extends out and latches for travel.  So they used a beaner to connect the two parts of the chain, gave it extra length just in case, and wrapped it around the hitch, secured with cable ties.  Oh boy.  Then they do a duct tape special on the light connector between the Bird and the tow lights, when it would have taken Mike about 10 minutes to just buy the interconnector and install it.  It was now after 5pm, and let's say they didn't do well on this fixed-price "no problem" install.  
<p>
We play parking lot polo with the hitch, getting used to towing.  Since Strata is still the stunt driver, having owned a 30-foot RV in the past, she's driving while Mike checks the tracking from the ground and radios in the clearance between us and various obstacles.  We do several tight turns and victory loops until we understand more or less what we can and can't do.  This is important, since we MUST NOT back up while hitched.  That isn't the stress the whole system was designed for, and unspecified but very terrible things will allegedly happen if we do so.  An attempt to get out of a tight spot in a gravel parking lot several days later gives us insight into this, but without doing any actual damage.  Basically the whole Echo started crabbing sideways about 6 inches, and Mike yelled "STOP!!!" into the radio, and I stopped.  Would have been ugly on pavement with a decent coefficient of friction instead of on slippery gravel-n-dust.  We got out another way, but that's later on.
<p>
So here we are in Dallas on a weeknight at 5:30pm with a vehicle we have about 10 miles driving experience with, and faced with going back to the hotel we've checked out of already or one nearby.  No way!  I insist on heading out of town, and Mike is appalled but willing to be a passenger.  We route around what ought to be the worst traffic by taking 635 South to I-20 West.  Mike's comment is that if I were a guy he'd say I had brass balls, and maybe he's right, but I was just NOT going to hang out another day.  It was Time to Get Going!
<p>
We ended up at 8pm at Cowtown RV Park, via Winn Dixie, and were more than ready to stop for the night.  We used the various campground books we'd picked up at Camping World to find likely targets, found one with a pull-through space, and a night registration procedure.  We sure didn't want to unhitch, since we had just gotten the hitch set up, and we weren't sure when we'd arrive with the traffic.  
<p>
Froze our buns off that night, since we didn't yet understand how to position the heaters for the right airflow.  Our first night in the coach, though, and the start of a great adventure.
