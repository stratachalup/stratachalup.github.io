Simon,
<p>
Please post to list, never emailed for posting access :-)
<p>
The power to at least parts of the 5th floor was returned until about 10 
minutes ago
(9:47 EDT).  The power as of now is as it was, completely gone as we await 
for the
generator fix.
<p>
No ETR I know of at this time."

<p>
I spoke too soon ;)
<p>
Power was restored to our equipment at 02:28 (UK)

<b>Telehouse 25 Update<br>
Thu, 13 Sep 2001 13:57:32 -0400</b>
<pre>
Akio Sugeno from Telehouse, via Nanog:
TELEHOUSE has been providing periodic updates to our clients regarding our
25 Broadway facility.  We'd like to share this latest update with the NANOG
list, thinking several of your members may be interested:
<p>
The TELEHOUSE 25 Broadway facility continues to run on generator with no
word from Con Edison on when power will be restored.  We're pleased to
report that the fuel delivery has arrived and our tank is now being
refilled.  Once done we will have fuel on site for more than four days.
We are beginning preparations to get replacement staffing into Manhattan
later today.  Client access into the building cannot be guaranteed at this
time, but you will be kept  informed as we get additional information.
<p>
Please continue to call (718) 370-9663 or email us for support as needed.
We will provide further update late this afternoon or as new information
develops.
<p>
Regards,
<p>

60 Hudson Update<br>
Thu, 13 Sep 2001 11:25:48 -0400</b>

Greg Pendergrass, via Nanog
<p>
60 Hudson is safe and the power is on. There is no danger of it collapsing 
although I think that has been said already. All the the Verizon phone 
lines are out, but cellphone service is good in and around the building. 
Some circuits are down but remarkably most are up. They aren't letting 
people get there from uptown just yet but hopefully they will in the next 
couple of days.
<p>
Anything south of Chambers St is likely going to be out for some time. I 
had to hike out of 61 Broadway (3 blocks south of the WTC) through it all 
and I can't see utilities restored for several days more as there is 
choking dust everywhere, debris, and untold gas leaks and other hazards. 
Many of the buildings around the WTC may be unstable after the collapse and 
must be inspected for safety before utility workers can go into the area. 
Some may have to be taken down before work can proceed (I hope not!). 1 
Liberty plaza is still up but who knows for how long? All the area telco 
providers must have taken significant losses in personnel and equipment so 
it's going to take them time to organize their repairs.
<p>
My building's management company is going to notify me as soon as we can at 
least enter and retrieve equipment, and I'll pass that update along to the 
list. If I can get in at 61 Broadway then probably people will be able to 
get into 25 Broad St and the adjoining buildings.
<p>
My hopes and prayers for everyone who has lost or is searching for their 
friends and loved ones.
<p>

Verizon damage and service disruptions
Date: 12 Sep 2001 22:40:48 -0700
From: Sean Donelan 
<p>
First, 1 Verizon employee and 3 Genuity employees are still missing, my
prayers, and I'm sure everyone else's prayers go out to their families.
No one wants to distract or impair the continuing rescue efforts in the area.
<p>
As Verizon continues its assessment of the damage, it is starting to
look worse than original reports.  Verizon hasn't filed an outage
report with the FCC, or the FCC has delayed its release.  So this is
based on Verizon's news conference and news reports.  The reports
aren't very clear in all the details.
<p>
The walls of the 140 West ST CO adjacent to the WTO Building 7 were breached
when Building 7 collapsed, and the building has flooded and the equipment
is covered with debris.  140 West St has no power.  Verizon needs to pump
out the building because it is 5 stories below ground.
<p>
Also mentioned is the Broad Street CO, which is experiencing intermittent
power problems.  The Broad Street CO supplies 80% of the New York Stock
Exchange lines, and the West Steet CO serves as the alternate CO supplying
20% of the NYSE lines.
<p>
The CO's supply 200,000 voice lines and 3 million separate private lines.
Although the NYSE had backup facilities, it looks like the disaster in
NYC is disrupting service from both CO's.  The telecommunication directors
of the exchanges have been meeting during the day.
<p>
According to news reports, Verizon left it unclear why a backup facility
somewhere else wouldn't be an adequate substitute for Wall Street's
financial community and stock trading.  According to one news report,
NYSE Chairman Grasso acknowledged that work is needed to come up with
a better telecommunications plan in the future.

The day after.  As always the priority is on the continuing rescue
efforts, and for the families of the victims.
<p>
Power problems are the concern for Internet services on the second day.
Internet reach ability appears to returned near normal, with certain
localized exceptions around New York City and circuits through New York
City to Germany and other European locations.
<p>
Rescue efforts may impact the network as debris must be moved or
demolished.  Reportly some carriers are operating on half-rings now,
so additional damage could result in more service disruptions.
<p>
Verizon lost 10 cell sites, Cingular Wireless lost 6 cell sites.  Some
cell sites were down to to power outages, some because the land lines
connected though equipment in the World Trade Center towers.
<p>
Verizon and Cingular are deploying additional mobile cell sites where
possible, and permitted by authorities.
<p>
Verizon has re-programmed Verizon owned payphones in Manhattan, providing
free local telephone calls.
<p>
Sprint and ATT Local Services had equipment in/near the World Trade Center.
Sprint reports several circuits are down, ATT Local Service reports their
equipment survived the inital collapse until the battery plant was exhausted.
<p>
25 Broadway is still on generator.  32 Old Slip is back up on generators,
after being down overnight. Fuel deliveries may or may not be allowed by
emergency authorities.  Much of it depends on the conditions of the streets
and safety of rescue works.
<p>
I don't have any first-hand reports from 60 Hudson, but everything appears
to be working.
<p>
The New York City web site www.nyc.gov seems to be down, congested or has
routing problems.  I can't reach it from any network I have access.
<p>
Access below 14th street is still restricted.  ISP engineers may or may
not be allowed access to facilities in lower Manhattan.  You should contact
the building owner for any special access requirements.
<p>
The dust in the air creates problems keeping the generators going.  If
prolonged run-times are required, its likely they will need to be shutdown
for maintenance (filter changes, oil changes, etc).  This could result in
periodic outages of a few hours.
<p>
The suspension of flights has also meant the suspension of spare parts.
Equipment failures (i.e card failures, chassis failures, etc) requiring
replacement parts will require swapping parts with other ISPs locally or
waiting until deliveries resume.
<p>
Most circuit repair activity in Manhattan has been suspended, except for
emergency circuits to hospitals and similar emergency response locations.
ISPs rarely have restoration priority on their circuits, so any circuit
failures should be expected to continue for a long-time.
<p>
Facility based carriers are not subject to restoration priority for their
own circuits.  However, restoration priority rules apply to any customer
circuits of those carriers, including other carriers or ISPs.
<p>
Several ISPs, Internet colocation facilities and other service providers
have offered assistance where possible in New York City, and other locations.
I expect most companies are willing to make special arrangements where
possible.
