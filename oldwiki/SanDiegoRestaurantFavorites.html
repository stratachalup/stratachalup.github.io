<p>
<PRE>
The 0xdeadbeef crowd chose Bully's, allegedly one of the best
places in San Diego for prime rib, and apparently were quite
happy there.  Heard second-hand.  Note for next trip.  ;-)
<p>
Also some lovely places a short jaunt from the Hotel Circle
Drive-- on and off freeway leads one to the district where
<a href="LeStat.html">LeStat</a>'s (a New Orleans style coffeehouse in San Diego) is
located, and it turns out to have a great Mexican (real Mexican!)
restaurant across the street, as well as a Russian place down
the block, and lots and lots of used bookstores.  Yay.
<p>
Tolerably decent seafood place in the mall down the road
from the hotel, and a very nice coffee shop (the bean scene?)
where I got several pounds of chocolate-covered espresso
beans for my tutorial.  
<p>
TAL lead us to a good Italian place not too far away, will
have to dig for the name of it...

i ate sushi dinner with some locals last nite.  my friend dug up his
sushi-guru who recommended a place.
<p>
it's called sushi ishikawa:
<p>
"Sushi Ishikawa is at 7905 Engineer Road. Easiest way to get there is to
take Balboa Ave. to Convoy Street. Go North on Convoy to Engineer Road,
turn right. The restaurant is on the right side in a little shopping center."
<p>
the phone number is 858 560 1782.
<p>
its a tiny mom and pop place, i'd definately call ahead if you are
gonna bring more than 4 ppl.
<p>
so on to the fish:
<p>
we sat at the bar, so we had the ability to order custom cuts and
special vegan rolls for my non-fishy friend.  the miso was unique, it
was much more fishy that i am used to, and i liked it.
<p>
i dont have much to say about the fist, it was perfect!  i had a spicy
tuna roll, smoked salmon sashimi, yellowtail sashimi (!!!) and some of
a creative burdock root (goba?) scallion and cuke.  the sushi guru got
that two part shrimp sushi/tempura action, and quite a few very
adventurous other rolls and things.
<p>
sushi guru said:
ichi bon "ug"
ono "okay"
ota "very good, but ishikawa is far better"
<p>
discuss. :)

One place I specifically remember from the previous 
ATC in San Diego was an Italian place called Asti in 
the Gaslamp district in downtown.
<p>
Fantastic Italian seafood.  I had a off-the-menu 
chef's special seafood stuffed portabello mushroom 
which was about the size of my head (and that's 
pretty big).
<p>
It wasn't cheap and it wasn't huge, but it was worth 
every (expense account) penny, and they managed to 
seat a group of about 12 or so of us in fairly short 
order even though it was pretty busy.
<p>
If you have the inclination for Italian, give it a 
try. I doubt you'll be disappointed.
<p>
Asti Ristorante
728 5th Ave.
Phone:   (619) 232-8844

Sushi Nippon

<a href="http://www.impactwebsites.com/sushibarnippon/"">http://www.impactwebsites.com/sushibarnippon/</a>
<p>
There are a couple sushi places in the Gaslamp that I
haven't been to yet. Sushi Nippon has been so
delicious and consistent, and great service, that I
haven't been able to tear myself away.
