one act play.  It is posted on my website at: <a href="http://www.renejoseph.com"">http://www.renejoseph.com</a>  
The play is an allegory for grief and healing.  I am sharing it in hopes of 
helping others to heal. (anonymous from mplsdslgw10poolb48.mpls.uswest.net)

<p>
While so many of us are still trying to cope with the events of September 11th, plans for commercial rebuilding on the former WTC site are being decided by NY officials. 
My mission is to see that the NY City Planning Committee hears, and acts on our opposing views.
<p>
Please read my Commentary.

Voices Unite for Memorial - Commentary by Anita Solomon
<p>
I am appalled by Larry Silverstein and John Whiteman! 
They, along with their small minded consortium, are already seeing $$$$ in the making, while bodies are still being recovered at Ground Zero!
This is a comtemptuous act, and needs to be acknowledged.
<p>
To place another money making entity at the WTC site is to desecrate the very grounds that became the end of life's journey for so many innocent people.
People need to realize that only a few hundred victims have been recovered and returned to the families, and given proper burial.  For those families, there is closure. More than 1,800 victims have yet to be recovered, and may never be. The right to a proper burial for these victims was violated insidiously.  
<p>
What do these families do?  When do they get to have closure? What do you tell a child when they ask "Where is Mommy's (Daddy's) grave?" 
<p>
Moreover, let us not forget that many of these people were from other nations, and their remains may never be recovered and returned to their homeland. 
Suffice it to say, that proper interment, according to their cultural doctrines, both in the U.S. and abroad, cannot be satisfied.
<p>
In a real sense, the former WTC site is now a "Cemetery of the World." Let them rest with dignity and in peace.
<p>
We are proud Americans!  How do you think we will look to the rest of the world if we just build over what is now proclaimed as the most poignant site in this Nation?
Americans would never hang their heads in shame, but I have to tell you, this just might do it. 
It should remain a memorial site and take it's rightful place in American history.  
<p>
In as much as I understand that replacing the towers would show our defiance and strength, I also feel that by turning the grounds into a memorial, it would show our enemies how much value and respect 'Westerners' (we so-called "infidels") have for human life.
<p>
There is plenty of commercial space available in NY, so it's not as if the city will lose out on profit making opportunities.
Even without the towers, we have proved our strength and determination! We gave the terrorists a hint of it! 
<p>
If you are interested in seeing that a Memorial be placed at Ground Zero, without commercialized edifice, please go to:

This petition is endorsed by many of the surviving victims, families and friends of those lost on 9-11, and linked to some of their websites as well. 
<p>
This petition will be hand delivered to Mayor Bloomberg's office, Governor Pataki's office, and the Planning committee for the former WTC site. 
Plans to deliver the petition will be March 11, exactly 6 months to the day.
