<p>
Additional details: Usually between 85 - 120 people.  Invite-only, but if you actually care about going, you almost certainly are enough of a part of the community to get an invite.  A camping event.  Usually rains at least once, often humid, always lots of starving mosquitoes desperate for a chunk of you.
