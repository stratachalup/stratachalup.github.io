Mike has been diving the past couple of days and having great fun.  There are lots and lots of artificial reefs out here.  There's an oil-rig supply boat, Black Bart, that he's been on twice, with spectacular fish life.  The other two sites were a section of suspension bridge that was sunk, and a Navy hovercraft.  Apparently the hovercraft was built with lots of watertight chambers for flotation, and took lots and lots of C-4 for them to actually get it sunk!  
<p>
We snorkeled out at Saint Andrews state park yesterday afternoon.  Unfortunately they're dredging in the channel, so the visibility sucks, but if you go up close to the jetty rocks there are all kinds of little things that live in holes there and are fun to watch!  We found the Lost City of the<a href="FringeHeads.html">FringeHeads</a>, and I reflected that Jim Henson must have been thinking of fringeheads when he designed some of his Muppets.  Those silly faces!  The weird brightly colored head-sprouts!  And that silly wide mouth!  It was also very keen to see all the activity in the splash zone around the rocks, watching the bubbles drive down as waves broke over the rocks, and seeing all the little baitfish chasing microscopic edibles.  The sea hares were out, and, like the minature version of MIT's Great Sail, the little ones were much cuter than the big ones.  ;-)  Think of a cross between an overstuffed parlor sofa and the giant snail in the old Dr Doolittle movie (but without a shell, of course) and that's a sea hare.  Someday I'll find some dowdy brown velveteen and make a sea hare pillow.  :-)
<p>
It's nice to settle down for a few days and not move.  We are here until Wednesday.  Then, I guess, off to Pensacola and from there to New Orleans, and continuing west.  It's a nice beach town here, and the fresh fish is awesome.  Mmmmmm, grouper that came out of the ocean hours ago!  And the Gulf shrimp (I know, I know, I shouldn't!) have that sweet taste that the clams did in Maine.  A lobster pound dealer in Maine told us that the sweet taste in shellfish is the layer of extra fat that they have.  If kept alive in tanks for more than 24 - 36 hours, they burn off that layer and don't taste as good.  That's why the supermarket lobster you get (outside New England) don't taste the same as the one you get at the lobster pound that came in yesterday afternoon.  
<p>
So far no problems with Birdie, but we still keep smelling that burning smell when we stop.  Wish we knew what it was.  D'oh!  When we smelled it last time, it was oil on the manifold, from the valve gasket seal.   That was changed out at Flagship RV in Clermont (wonderful folks! with someone who knows birds! Ask for George!), and seems to be holding fine, but oil is getting down there from *somewhere*.  Sigh.  It's always something.  
<p>
The cats, as always, wish they could go out.  The next-door neighbors' bird feeder seems to be a good consolation prize, though.  :-)

<h3>Vortex Springs, Ponce de Leon FL</h3>
<b>Fri, 04/25/03</b><br>
Well, we're off the great digital teat now for over a week, how time flies when you're not sitting in front of a computer all day.  :-)  And when you're having fun, snorkeling in Florida's amazing springs....   I'm on a borrowed diveshop dialup right now, so I'll have to make this brief...while 1219  messages, most of them spam, download.  I *so* have to make time to install Spam Assassin on kgate...
<p>
We have had a largely uneventful run here out to the Florida panhandle area.  This morning we were reminded that we were still in Florida by the weather radio going off at 4:30am-- tornadoes sighted nearby, severe line of storms, all the usual goodies.  Seriously torrential rains pounded the camper, but we stayed high and dry.  The most exciting part was the lightning strike somewhere within a couple of thousand feet.  Fortunately, we have no idea where it hit, and were unaffected.
<p>
We spent our last week at Clermont mostly visiting area springs again.  <a href="<a href="http://underwaterflorida.homestead.com/Wekiva.html">Wekiva"">http://underwaterflorida.homestead.com/Wekiva.html">Wekiva</a> Springs, near Orlando,</a> was very chilly at 72 degrees.  It had a great spring vent-- if you could freedive 15 - 18 feet to the bottom, grab the rocks and position yourself, it would shoot you out like a cannonball at a 45 degree angle for a Superman-style ride to the surface.  Much fun!  
<p>
First day's run was up to High Springs, FL, to visit the <a href="<a href="http://www.ginniespringsoutdoors.com">world-famous"">http://www.ginniespringsoutdoors.com">world-famous</a> cave & cavern diving center at Ginnie Springs</a>.  Ginnie has campsites, but a strict no-pets policy, so we weren't able to stay onsite, alas.  We were only a five to ten minute ride away, though.  What to say about Ginnie Springs?  Well, if you imagine a bunch of Unix geeks visiting Bell Labs in the mid-80's, you'll get an idea of how anyone into diving in an overhead environment feels about Ginnie.  People come from literally all over the world to be trained in cavern and/or cave diving there.   It turns out that our timing was at least mildly felicitous, in that the whole place had been flooded out about 2 weeks previously!
<p>
The afternoon we arrived, we visited the state park at <a href="<a href="http://www.ginniespringsoutdoors.com">Poe"">http://www.ginniespringsoutdoors.com">Poe</a> Springs</a> and snorkeled there.  The Santa Fe had recently visited Poe, as per our remark about flooding above, and the spring had not cleared itself yet.  It was like swimming in strong iced tea, yech.  Combine that with the big branches and snags on the bottom, and it got kind of creepy-- visibility of maybe 10 feet, which is way too close to be to something big that surprises you!  The good part was turtles, turtles, turtles, all the way down.  There was an enormungous one that someone caught to show his kids, about 2 feet across, a water slider type.  Then we found a small apple-sized baby snapper in the weeds by the edge, cute but feisty.  He really really wanted to bite us, but we held him very carefully (and briefly) just to look at him, and then let him go again.
<p>
We spent the next couple of days at Ginnie, and all I can say is "wow".  I wish I could upgrade my camera and get an underwater housing for it.  From down at the bottom,  in the main, namesake spring, you could look up 20+ feet into the blue sky and see people on the surface floating in the air among the trees.  The water is that clear.  Amazing.  Really, really marvelous.  Run channels carry the outflow to the nearby Santa Fe, and at the ends of the channels you can see (and feel) that warmer but ice-tea colored river water mixing in odd fractal boundaries.  The run channels themselves are quite marvelous, largely escaping the plague of exotic hydrilla and instead thick with elodea pushing out from the banks several feet on either side.  Sunfishes of all types and sizes dart in and out of the elodea, with guppies, darters, and colorful stickleback-like minatures.  Small turtles flee into the welcoming weeds, too quick for us to examine more closely!   Mike dove the Ballroom Cavern, where divers who aren't cave or cavern certified are allowed.   This huge chamber is over 300 feet long and 100 feet wide, and is apparently completely awesome.
<p>
We dove the Devil's Springs run at Ginnie as well, the Eye, Ear, and Hole.  The main vent there leads to an extensive system of caverns that go under the Santa Fe to another spring across the river.  A cave training class was stringing lines on the bottom and practicing  following the lines, with one buddy on the line and the other, with no mask, clinging to the first and also to the line.   "Stuff happens" in caves, so if you want to go there, you'd better be prepared to get out in less than ideal situations!
<p>
The other springs at Ginnie are Dogwood Springs and then Twin Springs and Deer Springs.  When we drove over to the latter pair, Twin Springs hosted the most savage mosquitoes we had yet encountered in Florida, and seemed unremarkable, so we felt that it wasn't worth braving the blood-suckers.  Deer Spring was even less remarkable, and the surrounding areas had standing water and a very evil smell, as if something large had died somewhere.  Definitely worth avoiding!  So when we came back the following day, we snorkeled Dogwood, and enjoyed Even More Elodea and fish life, including some exotics like tilapia and a big kind of chub or dace with red fins and silver body.   The sky was overcast, and it was late in the day, so we didn't get the full benefit of the light-- I imagine that Dogwood was much more like a big aquarium under better light conditions. 
<p>
Oh yes, the reason we didn't get out there until about 3pm that day was that the previous evening we'd found another vintage Bluebird parked at the campground where we were staying.  "The Town House" was a 1979 FC-35, a few years newer and a few feet longer than ours.  The owners, a very nice German couple with a good sense of humor, and their three cats, were touring the US from Canada.   They store the coach in Ontario and then come down for a few weeks-- he owns his own business, and can take an extended vacation now and then.  They bought their coach in August 2002, a few months after ours, and have had less trouble with it.  Perhaps until this past week-- we stayed up talking until late with them, and they'd had all the 12 volt lights on, but not the converter, thus draining the batteries.   Suddenly the lights went out, and Bonne and Mike got to play diagnosticians for a few hours, as well as the next day.  It seems that the electrical system changed (surprise!) and that there are 2 legs to it on that vintage FC.  On a 30-amp circuit, if you don't have a dogbone style connector like ours, you can only plug in one leg at a time.  They plugged in the back one, to run things in the kitchen for dinner, and never switched.  So the converter was *not* charging the batteries and powering the lights, and after many hours passed, wups!
It was great to meet other Bird owners, and swap stories (both good and bad) about the coaches.
<p>
The following day, Bonne and Inge left, heading south to Miami.  We wanted to continue a short distance to Branford, where we could dive and snorkel in a <a href="<a href="http://underwaterflorida.homestead.com/springs.html">series"">http://underwaterflorida.homestead.com/springs.html">series</a> of wonderful springs off the Suwanee River</a> Peacock, Convict, Troy, and Branford Springs.   Unfortunately, these springs were still at near-zero visibility from the earlier flooding, so we had to pass on stopping there.  :-(    But there was a consolation prize-- read on!
<p>
We stopped instead overnight at <a href="<a href="http://www.abfla.com/parks/FloridaCaverns/floridacaverns.html">Florida"">http://www.abfla.com/parks/FloridaCaverns/floridacaverns.html">Florida</a> Caverns State Park, </a> just a few miles off I-10 at Marianna.  Wow.  Wowie Zowie Kapowie.  The caverns were FANTASTIC.   The tour was too too too short, at about 45 minutes-- I could have stayed down there for many many hours.  I felt like we were on the set of various album covers, like Tales from Topographic Oceans.   The formations were extensive, and in many cases, pristine.  Imagine drapes (sometimes called "bacon formations") over 18 inches wide, hanging down for several feet, so fine that you could see a light shine through them.   Numerous soda straws in various stages of development, most in the 8 to 10 inch range.  Not bad when you consider that it takes about 100 years to grow a soda straw an inch!  There were cascades of rim pools, in one area not even featured on the tour there was a 12 foot tall "waterfall" formation made out of thousands of tiny tiny rim pools overlapping down the sides like some fantasy Andean city had terraced the mountainside since the days when the world itself was new.  
<p>
Our next stop was going to be Panama City, for some Gulf Coast scuba diving and snorkeling.  The weather refused to cooperate, as mentioned above, so we decided to stop at <a href="<a href="http://www.vortexspring.com">Vortex"">http://www.vortexspring.com">Vortex</a> Springs</a> first.   They have an extensive flood-control system that keeps the spring from getting flummoxed by the river or by run-off, and it works great.  We thought the water would look like chocolate milk after the downpour of this morning, but it's just fine and dandy.  Yay!  Mike did a dive yesterday into their cavern, which is apparently a wild place.  There's an air bell, a set of "artificial caverns" for training, and all kinds of interesting tchotchkes.  Air builds up on the roof of the cavern, creating pockets that are large enough to surface into and chat with other divers-- or get all the way out and walk around in the big sheet-metal air bell.  Sounds way cool, almost enough to tempt me to dive rather than snorkel today, but I'm still taking a vacation from diving.  It's more a vacation from Mike trying to run how I dive, given the degree to which that was a contributory factor in our accident two years ago (sigh).  At some point he'll be preoccupied long enough that I can schedule some instructor time and get back in the water MYSELF with no "help", but that's another story, and too long (and personal) for here.  
<p>
So we're bound for Panama City this weekend, and some snorkeling for me at <a href="<a href="http://www.floridaparks.com/stprks/north_west/"">http://www.floridaparks.com/stprks/north_west/</a> st_andrews_pic.htm">Saint Andrews state park</a> and some offshore wreck or artificial reef diving for Mike.   After that, it's a 1 day hop over to Pensacola, to the Naval Air Museum.  The next day's drive off to New Orleans, to a campground in Slidell about 30 miles away.  We'll day-trip into the city for yummy food, riding the St Charles trolley line, poking at various museums and the Aquarium of the Americas, and if we're lucky, some zydeco!  The Jazz Festival is going on this weekend and then May 1 - 4 weekend, but it's at the fairgrounds and is huge, and Mike doesn't like huge things (I'm not crazy on them either).  We'll see how the timing works out.

<b>Sun, 04/6/03</b><br>
the Great Neatening begins...
<p>
Today I scrubbed down the shower with 
great vigor, and unscrewed the bathroom faucet knobs to clean 
all the little scary things that live under there. 
<p>
Later today comes Restacking Objects, 
and Carpet Removal With Extreme Prejudice. Tomorrow bright 
and early (like, 7am-ish) we go to the flooring place, where 
they will install high-end vinyl floor tiling, the kind that doesn't look like vinyl, all throughout the coach. Curved 
things like the doghouse and wheel wells will get new carpeting. 
<p>
Since we have to pull out the driver 
and passenger seats to allow access for carpeting, I'll be 
out in the parking lot tomorrow scrubbing down the chairs 
with foaming leather cleaner and trying to get some of the 
black wear marks off the armrests.
<p>
The toilet is getting pulled (two bolts,
woo) so they can do the bathroom floor. While it's out, I'll 
take it apart and scrub it down, and Mike will replace the
plastic washers and fittings in it. We've had a fresh-water 
leak out the back, from the plastic fittings that attach to 
the flushing pedal. When you're not pushing down the pedal, 
fresh water streams out the back. So we turned the water off 
to the toilet, and flush by pouring water into it. This is 
annoying, and not as clean as self-flushing, meaning I have 
an Unpleasant Lysol Job to do every few days. The replacement 
toilet we'd like is a several hundred bucks, and I made the 
command decision that I'd rather have a better floor than a 
new toilet. We found a factory parts kit, so we decided to 
refurb rather than replace. 
<p>
After the flooring, the next official 
Big Project is tires. We're going to replace at least the 
2 steering tires, and depending on what the shop thinks of 
the other 4, maybe all 6 tires. Ugh. Very, very spendy, like 
$1800 out the door. Bus tires are not like car tires, they're 
14-ply load rating G, to deal with our 29,000 pound GVWR at 
highway speeds.
<p>
The next Little Project is putting up 
towel bars in the bathroom, to replace the ugly 70's hooks 
there. The hooks were at one point those lucite towel ring 
things that won't actually hold an actual bath towel, bah. Apparently there were real towel bars at one point, since 
someone has put in little decorative brass tacks where the 
former holes were. I know what I want, and I've found it 
before in either a Lowe's or a Home Despot, but I have to 
measure to make sure they're not some weird                   size. 
<p>
Oh yeah, and I want to drill a teeny 
hole for the nifty cheep wall fish we bought at Mallory Square in 
the Keys. 
<p>
The bathroom mirrors are a problem. The 
wall-size square one on the back wall is basically fine, but 
the big oval one over the sink has had the mirroring chip off 
in a few places under the rim on the bottom. I'm thinking maybe 
I can make some kind of decorative border around the oval that 
will hide the chips. Unfortunately, the lines of the coach, 
particularly in the bathroom, are such that you can't add much 
to it without looking bad. The aircraft-style detailing, like 
the rounded shower door opening lined with aluminum trim, and 
the recessed-knob cabinets, is very sleek and spartan. Decals 
'n' details dork out fast, looking like Granma's place from the 
70's. Yeek.
<p>
Guess we'll see what we can do, it's all 
an iterative process.

<b>Sat, 04/05/03</b><br>
salty, but much less interesting
<PRE>
                     Today we went to Salt Springs recreation area. A saline spring with multiple deep vents and caverns, it spews out over 50 million gallons a day-- quite a little current to swim against near the river buoys. Unlike yesterday's Alexander Springs, the underwater life was disappointing. The weekend crowds sure didn't help the experience, either! 
<p>
                     The area was covered with thick water plants that in many places were so tall that snorkeling was difficult. I expected to find either great diversity or simply vast quantities of fish, given the lush plant life. Neither expectation was fulfilled. I discovered once we returned that the plant life was primarily hydrilla, a pernicious imported waterweed with a well-deserved reputation for strangling out native species. I observed many of the fish feeding, and saw that they uniformly chose other species of plants or algae. The relatively barren ecosystem was probably the result of the hydrilla infestation. 
<p>
                     I was quite disappointed to see only 3 or 4 types of sunfish, a couple of schools of dace or minnows, and a school of mullet, and (of course!) the odd largemouth bass or two. The mullet are very silly looking fish of a dull greyish color. Their habit is to pull up large strings of water plants and partially ingest them. I'm not sure if they're eating the plants or eating the snails that attach themselves to the plants. They are usually bloop blooping their large oval mouths, giving them a foolish appearance which is in no way contradicted by their large glassy grey eyes. They somewhat made up in quantity what they lack in quality. Seeing over a hundred 2 - 3 foot long fish going by in a long narrow school, or spread out grazing along the bottom, is still pretty neat, even if they're mullet. Not a patch on the huge school of silvery, yellow-tipped permit (round pompano) we saw at Silver Glen Springs, though. 
<p>
                     Schools of a dozen or two sunfish were common, usually of 4 - 6 inch fish of varying but similar sizes. Occasionally a school would be escorted by one or two very large (12 - 14 inch) individuals. An area against the far wall had a decent population of adult sunfish, while it was primarily juveniles in the rest of the spring. 
<p>
                     Free-diving down into the spring boils was pretty interesting-- the volume of water is amazing, and will give you the "superman experience" of flying you back up and out once you turn around and stop fighting it. Some very excellent (though insane!) free-divers were actually penetrating the caverns back about 10 feet inside. Yeeee. I wonder how many times they have to haul highschool kids out of there in a bag-- several of the boils have overhanging rock ledges and similar that could easily bonk someone who was in too much of a hurry to get back up to the surface to breathe. The teenagers and pre-teens were all around the caverns and daring each other to dive down deeper. Every now and then the folks actually snorkelling, with equipment, would get a chance to go down and see stuff. Unfortunately, all the kids standing on the ledges kicks up the algae, making underwater photography less than sterling, so Mike brought up the camera back up to the car in disgust after a fairly short time.
<p>
                     Still, even a bad day in the water is better than a good day at work. :-) Today was far, far from "bad", it was just nowhere near "world class" like yesterday at Alexander.

another of G-d's little aquariums
<p>
<PRE>
          Alexander Springs, in the Ocala National Forest area, north central Florida. Truly incredibly amazing. 
<p>
          I don't think I've ever seen so many types and life stages of fish in a freshwater setting before. Sunfish of many kinds-- redear, bluegill, redbreast, warmouth, crappie. Chubs and darters and guppies and killifish and all kinds of fishies large and small. Striped bass, smallmouth bass, grass carp. A really small turtle close up and grazing, a really BIG turtle several feet away, briefly through the weeds at the shoreline.
<p>
          Yay G-d. Yay aquarium. Yay fishies!

the reptiles and I
<PRE>
                     It may seem trivial, but I got a big kick out of witnessing one of Nature's little dramas yesterday. 
<p>
                     I spent part of yesterday afternoon in one of the 3 pools here at the campground, namely the one that gets afternoon shade.
                     Just soaking my sunburn and waiting to go into reptile phase-- half a bottle of aloe, applied over the past few days,
                     converted some of my sunburn to brown, but I'm still going to peel.
<p>
                     As I was leaving the pool, I noticed motion on top of a big wooden bin in the Pool Care Stuff enclosure next to the pool.
                     One of the several zillion anole variants that inhabit this place was strutting his stuff on a corner of the bin. This guy was
                     dark brown with a few black dashed racing stripes. He was doing a full territorial display, with head-bobbing and
                     bouncing. Then he made an illustration in the field guides make sense-- he pulsed out a bright red throat dewlap! 
<p>
                     I don't mean Generic Critter Red or even Macaw Red here, I mean Fluorescent Strawberry Muscle Car Red. Wow!
                     Sure, it was only the size of my fingernail, and the lizard was only about 5 inches long, but I was impressed. Apparently I
                     was in the minority. Swiftly scrabbling up and over the top of the box, along came a 6+ inch anole. He quickly came along
                     and rushed the first one, quickly taking the corner in a round of furious head-bobbing. 
<p>
                     This new lizard's dewlap was an even deeper red, and correspondingly larger than the first's. He also came with a tiny
                     entourage of 3 to 4-inch-long lizards, who took their positions in the remaining corners, each facing outwards and doing a
                     few head-bobs. The big anole pulsed his dewlap about once per second in a series of vivid red flashes. After several
                     seconds, he settled back and regally surveyed his domain. 
<p>
                     "I am the Lizard King! I can do anything!"

Florida Keys trip report
<PRE>
                     I have a really bad sunburn, should have known better! We didn't see the sunset in Key West due to rainstorm, but had a
                     good time in Islamorada the next couple of days, mostly diving & snorkeling. 
<p>
                     I missed snorkelling the first day out, on a visit to Looe Key. We were rushed, ate lunch too fast (bad idea before going on
                     a boat), and there was enough wind that the sea was choppy. I spent both stops laying in the bottom of the boat (sigh) and
                     breathing deeply. Was ok by the time it was time to go back in, alas. Should have brought the Bonine.
<p>
                     The 2nd day I didn't go on the boat, as the previous day was too vivid. Mistake-- it turned out that it was mostly flat, and
                     Mike said the water was like glass by the second dive. Bah. I rented a dive float, required for snorkeling, and towed it
                     behind me doing some shore-based snorkeling around mile marker 80, near the Lignum Vitae Key Preserve. I saw some
                     of the usual reefy suspects, and more coral recruitment than I expected in near-shore waters, especially near an active boat
                     channel (silt, etc). Tales of the huge numbers of huge bugs -- spiny lobster -- under the bridge rocks got the managers of
                     the motel where we stayed all excited. They were both divers, and wanted to put some lobster tail in the freezer for when
                     their relatives come to town. Alas for them, the season only goes to March 31, so they weren't sure if they'd get out in the
                     next day or so before it finished.
<p>
<p>
                     I went on the boat on the 3rd day, to Davies' Reef and Spanky's Spine, fortified with a Bonine. I saw good fish but got a
                     rippin' sunburn. The highlight was the first few minutes of the snorkel, when a 6 - 8 foot reef shark was gliding over the
                     turtle grass just a teensy handful of fathoms below me. They're pretty mellow, so I wasn't concerned, just very very jazzed.
                     I've only seen 1 to 2 foot long nurse or spotted sharks while diving or snorkeling before. Yeah! Wouldn't be too happy to
                     see a tiger or a mako, let alone a great white, but a reefie is cool.
<p>
                     Mike did dives all 3 days and had fun. He was in the Keys about 14 years ago, and says its a LOT more built up than
                     before. I wish we had brought the motorhome down so we could stay longer, oh well. We got back to Birdie at about
                     6:30pm on Monday the 31st, put stuff away, went and got dinner at our local Mexican place.

                     We were supposed to get the coach a routine oil and lube on April 1st, but the truck garage got some other work and
                     "forgot" our appointment when we called to confirm it on the way home. Bah. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise,
                     though-- we got the work done today at the local big RV dealership and found a mechanic who'd been working with
                     Bluebirds and similar bus-chassis rigs for over 30 years. Yay! He went over everything with a fine-tooth comb, and found
                     a few things that could have been real problems later, such as a place where a fuel line was rubbing against the drivetrain.

                     Birdie ran spritely down the road, and had no problems with the steep hill just outside the campground. We're gonna keep
                     our fingers crossed on the repair work from December and our new carb and ignition system. The mechanic today found
                     that they hadn't installed the throttle springs quite right, and that, not the set-screw level, was why Birdie has been idling
                     high. Interesting. He didn't find anything else funky, which is good. Here's hoping!

                     Tomorrow I rescue the puffs from Durance Vile, otherwise known as the cat boarding facility at South Clermont Animal
                     Hospital. Poor poofies! They'll have to go back overnight on Monday, since the flooring place had to move our
                     appointment to Monday instead of tomorrow, and he expects it to take a couple of days.

                     Bzz bzz bzz. I thought we were supposed to be on some kind of vacation here. Life expands to fill all available time. Not
                     complaining, just noticing. Still have an article to complete this week, but at least my contract is finished and invoiced as of
                     today. Yay!<hr>
