<b>Friday Aug 16 - Monday Aug 25</b>
<p>
(Friday Aug 16) They had Elvis movies on most of the channels.  The local paper here
said they were having a concert with a "nationally known" Elvis 
impersonator, as a tribute concert for the one that never happened.
If you bring in your original ticket for the 1977 concert, they would
give you $15 off the price of the tribute concert.  Of course, I saw
in the classifieds that people were selling their old original tix
for $50 - 100, but I don't know if that was Asking or Getting price,
ya know?
<p>
Mike's been working at the trolley museum (volunteering), and I have
been mostly cleaning and sorting-- we still have papers that we just 
tossed into a bag, oh well.  I need to ask Dr Lisgar if he will renew
my allegra/allegra-D/singulair prescriptions as he said he would when
I was in town.  Otherwise, cold turkey!  Oh well.  Today I need to drive
down to Rochester NH since that is the closest Walgreens to here.  Used the
old-fashioned navigation technique of using a map to get to the town dot,
and then asking directions at the general store.  :-)
<p>
(Monday Aug 19) This was Mike's "day off" from volunteer work, so we went
into Kennebunkport and found some tide pools, spent a couple hours chasing
critters around and getting salty.  Then we cleaned up and walked around
town, ended up in a bookstore (imagine, us in a bookstore! :-)  ), and
had a nice time.  Two particularly nice children's books, "DaVinci's Horse"
and "One Less Fish".  The former tells the story of<a href="DaVinci.html">DaVinci</a>'s bronze horse,
which was never cast, and how an American philanthropist and<a href="DaVinci.html">DaVinci</a> fan
caused it to be built in the US and shipped to the town in Italy for which
it was commissioned in the late 1400's.  There is one copy made from the
same mold, by one of the other donors, that is in the US, I believe in Grand
Rapids Michigan.  The book tells how<a href="DaVinci.html">DaVinci</a>'s notebooks ask whether he was
a failure at last, due to so many unfinished projects and no huge accomplishments
to which he could point.  Ouch.  I have to work on that one.  The other book
had the most jewel-like, luminescent illustrations that I have ever seen.  I 
thought at first that they were pictures of cloissone! The back cover explains 
that they were silk paintings-- wow.  I should have bought it, and might go
back for it.  :-)  The book was published in conjunction with the Australian
Great Barrier Reef preservation group, and tells a counting story of "one less
fish" about reef fish and the things that cause reef attrition.  Good for kids
without being preachy, and truly amazing illustrations.  A book for adults by the
American Littoral Society was also of interest, title something like "Shore Savers Guide".
It talked about programs I had never heard of, such as Riverkeeper, where a person 
volunteers to be responsible for the quality of a river and becomes a citizen 
watchdog supported by other volunteers and water quality sampling.  I need to
go ping their website and see if there's a downloadable version.
<p>
We saw scads of rambling roses along the beach with huge colorful
rosehips.  I looked them up in the "Eastern Medicinal Plants" book
and found that they're actually asian landscaping roses, not native at
all.  The rosehips are edible, and I've heard of folks making a kind of
marmalade from them-- very good in vitamin C.  I might try harvesting
some and seeing how that works.  Not from in front of the million-dollar
homes on Ocean Street, but from across the street by the public beach,
of course.  :-)  Back at the coach, laundry was threatening to overwhelm
us, so we did two loads of whites and saved the colors for tonight.  Whee.
<p>
(Tuesday) Woke up around 6am to cold and some light rain, rescued our sandals which
were still outside on the mat.  Boo was being an ubermonster, racing around
the coach with her ears laid back.  I said, "Fine, you want to go out, go
out, ha!", thinking that she would quickly come back in due to the rain
and her inexperience with The Great Outdoors.  Wrong.  She raced off to 
the grassy patch at the edge of our site to eat some grass, then led me
a merry chase for about 20 minutes.  Finally something scared her, a car
or a person or ?? in the distance, and she dove for the safety of the
front door.  What a naughty creature.  I have been making sketches for 
an outdoor cat "balcony" but haven't built one yet.  I need to get going
on that.  At least this cold front and the one coming in soon mean that
we will be able to keep the windows open rather than running the AC.  The
cats like it so much better when they can sniff the outside.
<p>
A visit to the ongoing outdoor Antiques/Etc fleamarket at Rt 1 & Log Cabin
Road (where we turn for the trolley museum) was rather bittersweet-- too much
stuff from my childhood and my grandma's house was on the tables as antique!
Yeesh!  :-)
<p>
(Wednesday Aug 21)  Snorkeling today at Cooch Beach, aka Colony Beach, on
Ocean Street across from the Colony Hotel.  That's where the tidepools/rocks
were that Mike and I visited Monday.  Cold cold cold cold brrrrrrr.  I only
lasted about 40 - 45 minutes.  Going back next time with the surf suit (3 mil)
and expect to do much better.  
<p>
(Thurs Aug 22-- Happy Birthday, Mom!!!)  Today I went up to the Acton Fair 
and petted the 4H llamas, saw the oxen judging, traded opinions about varmint control with
an elderly gentleman from the county gun club, and chatted with a
truly charming lady spinning yak-fleece roving into yarn on an
intricate tabletop spinner that looked like a cross between a
Victrola and Sleeping Beauty's spindle.  :-)  Tonight I'm meeting
Mike at the Trolley Museum for their Sunset Ride & Ice Cream event.
Tomorrow is Reading Day-- they were setting up tables this morning,
and as I left after dropping him off I saw a Scholastic Books truck
inbound.
<p>
(Friday)  Returned to the Acton Fair with a collection of Boo fluff, to see if the 
spinners could give me advice about making yarn from it and separating the guard hairs
out vs leaving them in.  This was inspired by a book at the feet of one spinner, entitled
something like "Spin Your Dog's Hair: Better a Sweater from a Dog You Love than from a 
Sheep You Never Met".  Alas, the spinners weren't there.  The Boo fluff was starting
to felt just from being in a plastic bag, despite my precautions in handling it.  We'll
mark this issue "unresolved".  Don't worry, there's *plenty* more fluff where that came from!
Snark's coat doesn't really have guard hairs, just a silky underfur that looks like angora.
I'll save fluff when I next groom her as well.  Those who are allergic might shudder at the
thought of spinning cat fur.  Remember that people are allergic primarily to cat dander and
to the proteins in the saliva, not to the hair itself.  These will be removed by the washing
process when the piece is completed.  The final product will be virtually allergen-free.
Whether I get that far remains to be seen, though!  
<p>
Although they were not listed on the program, there were competitions in
draft horse and draft pony cart/driving for that day.  I spent several hours on the fence
by the horse ring watching gorgeous Belgians, Percherons, and Halflingers carting singly
and in small teams.  The Halflingers are a very personable and attractive draft pony,
sturdily built.  They've become quite popular, and make a wonderful driving pony for a
light cart or trap.  There were women-only driving classes, and the entries were ususally
brightly beribboned, driven by women costumed in simplified 1900's garb.  Very nice!  One
of the Percherons, entered in several events, was a bit rowdy-- I kept a nervous eye when
that team, or individual horse, was going past my spot on the fence.  When a pair of 2400
pound horses is trotting right at you, theoretically about to turn the corner, you pay
very close attention.  You also think about where you're going to throw yourself if they
cut the corner too short and clip the fence with the big iron-wheeled wagon.  
It's an impressive vantage point, not unlike standing next to the platform when the train
arrives.  
<p>
I spent some time chatting with a mom in the 4-H dairy goat area.  She was coaching her son
as he prepared his little Nubian yearling for the showmanship class.  Apparently there is 
no real dairy goat club for 4-H in this part of Maine.  Folks from different areas hook up
with the general club or the sheep club, and just see each other at fairs.  There's not
enough of a presence to start a club of their own, and people are scattered fairly far
geographically.  Nice folks, though!  On the way home from the fair, I stopped off at a 
local lake beach to swim.  Odd place-- like a sunken meadow underneath, with sand dumped on
a section to make a little "beach".  Some pond grass, but also surface plants, with the tiny
ones still green as if they'd sprouted recently, and the bottom covered with dark brown oak
leaves.  Big snails, two to three inches long, were seen at intervals, and the occasional
fingerling fish (plus one fullsize lake trout).  Overall a kind of weird place, and I cut
my swim short at only 40 minutes because the underwater view was creeping me out!
<p>
Meanwhile, back at the Trolley Museum, Mike and another volunteer had been drafted to help
with the balloons for the Reading Festival.  He spent 4 hours blowing up and tying balloons,
and said he felt like soaking his fingers in icewater afterwards.  Phew!  The festival was
apparently a great success, and the families enjoyed riding the variety of trolleys they
had out for the day.  
<p>
(Saturday) I got off to a slow start, dithering about whether or not to go up to the National
Folk Festival in Bangor for the day.  I hadn't spent a quiet shabbat at home for 
a while, and felt that maybe I should stay home to rest and study.  I decided to go up anyway,
since I'd feel like I was missing out if I stayed home.  These things are so complicated
sometimes!  Mike was doing the museum, since Saturday and Sunday are the primary volunteer
days for folks who can't help during the week.  He was looking forward to meeting the
equivalent of the track crew up at RVJ, the weekend warriors who keep things going.
<p>
It turned out to be about 150 miles up to Bangor, but it was a nice day for driving.  I
found perfect festival weather, for me at least, when I arrived-- overcast and moist but
not actually raining, with temperatures in the low 70's.  Great for dancing or for sitting
in a chair listening without the sun beating down on you!  :-)  OK, not everyone felt the
same way, but at least someone appreciated the weather, and I used to live in Maine, so there.
I arrived late (2pm) and missed a couple of the folks I wanted to see, but since the action
started at noon I didn't miss too much.  I spent almost all of the day at acoustic fiddle
performances, starting with the "Traditional Fiddlers", a panel of folks with distinct
regional styles taking turns playing and talking about the differences in style.  There
was Simon St Pierre, Quebecois fiddler; Mary<a href="MacIsaacs.html">MacIsaacs</a>, Cape Breton; Charlie Walker, 
Missouri; Fletcher Bright, Tennessee hills; and Liz C---(!brain failure!), Chicago Irish.
Wow!  Awesome!  Actually, I caught a little of Liz C and John Doyle's set before the panel,
and that was great too.  The Bluegrass Tradition Band was next, and really caught the house
on fire.  Then it was time for the Upland Fiddlers panel, which featured Charlie and Fletcher
again, and also Andre Brunet and a couple of other folks whose names I didn't catch.  They
played in turns with each other, one or two accompanying the one whose turn it was seemingly
by prearrangement.  I was fascinated to hear about the particular influences of the fiddlers
on both panels, and wrote down names in the hope of finding recordings by some of the folks
mentioned.  Apparently many were never recorded, alas!
<p>
I missed most of the Canadian step-dancing folks by touring the craft fair.  Standard (but very
nice) stuff you'd expect, and a couple of things that really caught my eye.  Recall that I've
gotten interested lately in spinning and similar craftwork.  A spinners farm was there featuring
products ranging from raw wool & hides to finished pieces.  They were selling a rug kit for a
craft I'd never heard of before but think I'd like to try.  It's Australian lattice weaving.
Think of bargello, or anything you do on a plastic grid.  Now make the grid in quarter-inch
squares (quite large!), and what you're weaving in and out is cleaned roving, the long "ropes"
of cleaned and carded wool.  You tie it down with bulky sweater yarn, and it puffs around the
yarn.  You can double-weave as well, and join in different colors to make patterns.  The result
is a rug that's very puffy and cushiony, feels soft, and looks great.  I'm not sure how washable
it is though!  The folks at that farm do a bit of dye work as well, and had dyed yarns and
some fascinating books on plant dyes and mordants.  I jotted down titles, since I've done far
too much book acquisition lately for someone who lives in a 31 by 8 rolling box.  ;-)
<p>
After a visit to the music tent, where I bought far too many CD's, but at least one less than
I later wished I'd bought.  I finished up the evening hearing<a href="BeauSoleil.html">BeauSoleil</a> for the first time,
and discovered I could still dance an hour set!  Wow, wow, and double wow-- if you get a chance
to hear these folks, DO IT!  That is, if you like Cajun and Zydeco music at all.  Hint-- if
you like Celtic rock, you will like this.  The CD I wish I'd gotten is the live<a href="BeauSoleil.html">BeauSoleil</a>
disk.  Since I hadn't heard them yet, and knew I was only there for 1 day, I took the safe
route and got a "Best of the Crawfish Years" disc which had selections from 1991 - 1998.  They
have improved, and they're much more awesome live, though the disk is truly great.  Now all I
had to do was the 2.5 hour drive back home, but the stompin' good music got me home safe and
sound around midnight:30.  I hope we can make it back for next year's festival, 
though I'd also like to do some summer things on the California/Oregon coast next summer. 
Maybe 2004 then, since it will
be in Bangor for the next 2 years.  I'm definitely going to try to make it part of my
travel schedule in the future!  There's a bluegrass festival at a local beach resort over
Labor Day, but it's $18 to get in and I don't see how it could beat what I heard for free
this past weekend!  Maybe I'll finally make it to Strawberries this year back on the other
coast-- we'll see.
<p>
(Sunday) A boring cleaning day at the coach, since I'd been sluffing off to fairs and festivals
and things were getting grungy.  Also, we were moving campgrounds the next day, so it's good to
be tidy.  Tossed various outside stuff like chairs into the car, swept and de-furred the rugs,
did some remedial refrigerator cleaning, etc.  Mike got a lift home from the museum and arrived
just in time to help vacuum-- lucky him!  :-)  We went out in search of food afterwards, being
way too zonked to actually cook.  We discovered that places close RATHER early on Sunday
compared to what we're used to, but found a great Chinese/Polynesian place outside downtown
Biddeford.  We'd been headed for the Dry Dock, a nice family seafood/diner type place just over
the hump on Rt 1 from the trolley museum, but they were already closed at 8:30pm.  Wups!

<h3>Wyman's Beach Family Campground, Westford MA</h3>
<p>
Having fun in Boston area; went to Lowell and did the Mill tour today,
went to Story-Reading on Monday, Tuesday a rest day, and tomorrow (Thurs)
into Boston/Cambridge/etc for touristy things and the New Balance factory
outlet.
<p>
Where to start-- I have to keep these things more up to date while happening.
At least there was a modem jack in the laundry room here so I got online
every couple of days.  
<p>
Wonderful microIRR gathering of some Westford/Chelmsford locals (thanks Keith!)
where I got to re-meet some folks and meet some people for the first time--
but not the last!  Mike and I returned to the VMajestic for a dinner run for
the first time in 5 years, and I was promptly recognized by the proprietor.
Mary Chungs on Thursday was also fun, though a small turnout compared to last
year.  Not surprising since my organizational skills were on vacation too, and
I only announced it on Sunday or Monday before.  Mary also recognized me and 
was very pleased to meet Mike.  Grin.  I took a petty glee in the early 80's
from how she used to pester my ex-boyfriend when he was in with my successor,
asking him "where is your other friend?  You used to be here with her all the
time?"  Tee hee.  
<p>
The Lowell Mills tour was wonderful, and I meant to go back to see the quilt
museum but that never quite happened.  We didn't do much touristy stuff, since
I was working on a login column and we were both swimming an hour a day when
we got the chance.  The lake at Wyman's Beach was very nice, and had quite the
living aquarium of fishies.  The sunfish, bluegills and pumpkinseeds, would
follow you around to see what you kicked up while fin-swimming.  Yellow perch
were seen frequently in the weeds, and now and then bigger stuff-- a couple of
either walleyes or muskies by the camper's beach, huge buffalo carp (2 - 3 ft)
in twos and threes at the public beach in the shallows.  I got close enough to 
one of them to touch it, trying to get to where I could open my arms along its 
length to get a more accurate sense of how big it was.  Yow!
<p>
Here til Friday Aug 16th.
