<p>Tell them how to proceed, and think carefully before you do.  Do you want "war" or do you want action?  Do you want more airline security? Do you want the US to team up with other countries to track down terrorists rather than carpet-bombing other countries? Do you want the guilty brought to justice rather than causing other mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, children of innocents to grieve? Would the "best revenge" be to transform the religious dictatorship countries into participatory democracies, rather than sending planes and bombs?</p>
<p>OK, you can guess my views on the situation from my loaded questions above, but my views may not be your views.  And it's equally important that you get YOUR views in to your representatives so they'll get some idea of what the American people want to have happen!</p>
