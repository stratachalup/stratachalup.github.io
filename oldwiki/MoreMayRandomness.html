<b>5/31/03</b>
<p>
Our move from Morgan Hill went fairly smoothly, and we are now settled into this nifty little RV park smack dab in the middle of San Jose's industrial wasteland. It's a little oasis from 1958, formerly a mobile home park that was converted to RV spaces. The rent is decent ($750 plus utils, 2 month minimum stay) and the spaces are large. We actually have a Tiny Bit O' Lawn, as well as a large chunk of driveway behind the motorhome. Several folks here have put up those lovely 12 x 12 foot ironwork-sided canvas-topped shade shelters from Home Despot, with screens and beach-mat shade walls. I covet such a thing highly, but am not likely to spring for one until/unless either of us are working. For amusement, we can walk to the Berryessa Flea Market on Sundays, which is way cool. This also saves us the parking fee-- there's no admission fee, only a parking fee. :-)
<p>
Shopping will be interesting, since it's several miles to the local Albertson's or<a href="SafeWay.html">SafeWay</a>, and the ones I've visited so far are rather dodgy.  Still, the place is economical enough that I don't mind shopping up in Sunnyvale or Mt View, since I go up there enough on other errands. The prices on things were also ridiculous-- 99 cents each for the same Yoplait yogurts that we were getting for "5 for $3" (ie 60 cents) in Florida and even 79 cents in Morgan Hill. Bah humbug! I wasn't about to pay $3.69 a box for Celestial Seasonings Almond Tea, my favorite tea to make for iced tea, when I know that the prevailing rate is usually about $2.99 per box. They weren't carrying that flavor, as it turned out, so I didn't have to grit my teeth over the decision.
<p>
On Wednesday, I picked up our first box of vegetative edibles from our local CSA. These folks have teamed up with another farm in a slightly different microclimate, and are doing business as "Two Small Farms". Getting a huge box of organic goodies for $20 a week seems like a good deal to us, especially when we'll get sky-high-spendy things like tomatoes and strawberries. They have lots of handy pickup locations on both sides of the hill, and they still have shares left. Give 'em a try! Not in the SF Bay area? Find a CSA local to you online.  (Look up "community supported agriculture" in Google or similar and there are lists by state of farms)
<p>
Speaking of strawberries, I wish I could have gone down to Watsonville today, as they were having a U-pick strawberry day for members, but I can't pick stuff on Shabbos. Darn! Maybe there'll be more berries in this week's box, the ones from last week are almost gone already. Then again, we have limited freezer space, but I'd love to try making strawberry jam. My little Walmart breadmaker even has a "jam & jelly" setting, so I clearly have to try it. :-) There was an excellent article in the Atlantic recently about an artisan jam & jelly maker operating out of the Ferry Building Market in SF, and I feel inspired. 
<p>
Community-supported agriculture is something we've wanted to try for a long time, but being on the move most of the last year wasn't really helpful. I'm still planning on getting some flowers and a cherry tomato plant, but joining the CSA will give me a much greater range of veggies than I can grow myself, having gotten a very late start. I might get a couple of summer squash and/or zucchini plants. We love to steam the little baby ones, which is practically self-defense when dealing with summer squashes. I've also seen a very interesting recipe for stuffed squash blossoms and would like to give it a try. 
<p>
Since I was out of almond tea, I decided to try making some Constant Comment tea. While opening my tea tin, that special fragrance reminded me that I still had some special blend jasmine tea in there. Huzzah! It made absolutely lovely iced tea, even for a milk-in-tea philistine such as myself. I had passed on some rose petal black tea at the Silver City NM food co-op, and will have to find some locally, as that should make wonderful iced tea as well. I still have "peach rooibos" on my list of things to find and get small quantities of, since a friend who is writing a novel described it so invitingly that I just have to try some. Oh yes, and rooibos or black tea with lychee, which sounds completely heavenly. 
<p>
I usually do non-caffeinated ice teas, flavorful or aromatic enough that I don't need sweetener in them. I find that a quart gatorade container has a wide enough mouth to easily take the half-moon ice cubes from our RV's icemaker. Filling the container about 2/3 full of ice will let me pour a 4-cup coffeemaker potful of hot tea into it. A few shakes (after putting on the cover) and the whole thing reaches an equilibrium of slightly cool with a few slivers of ice remaining. One teabag, or a tablespoon of loose tea, makes a good strong pot. I usually dilute it a little bit further in the glass, but that's just me. :-)
<p>
This method makes ice tea with the Celestial Seasonings teas quite economical, ditto the spendy flavored loose teas at specialty tea stores. I credit it indirectly to an old friend who used to put a CS teabag into his espresso maker to get a Really Strong cup. Often the tea-source is strong enough that I can put another 8 - 10 ounces of water through it in a second batch, to get a side mug of iced tea to drink right then and there. 
<p>
Tea by itself is good, but tea with rice pudding bread is even better. I had made extra brown rice the other day, so as to have some left over to try the recipe. It was yummy, despite not coming out as planned. I increased the amount of rice from 3/4 cup to 1 and 1/4 cup, and added a little olive oil. Then I ran into a bit of a snag-- I knew that I didn't have any sour cream, but thought I'd use some of Mike's plain nonfat yogurt instead. I hadn't realized that he'd finished it off at breakfast. I was also out of regular milk, having only canned milk around. So I used powdered buttermilk and water as a substitute for the sour cream, and used a bit too much water. This made things a bit too gloopy, so most of the rice and all of the raisins settled into the bottom third of the loaf. Notwithstanding, it was still delicious. I'll just try to do it more accurately next time. :-)

<h3>Maple Leaf RV Park, Morgan Hill CA</h3>

boil that dust speck...  We are Here!
<p>
We got back on Wednesday afternoon, and it's been non-stop ever since. Drove out to Santa Cruz to check out RV sites, found a nice one up in the hills between SC and Scotts Valley. I may have a short gig coming up within a week or so, though, which kind of nixes our plans to spend 4 - 6 weeks in that area while job-hunting! It's kind of a cloud and silver lining all in one; would be nice to be bringing in some income, but I thought I'd have a little time to just visit and get back in the "mindset". So we'll stay on this side of the hill for now instead of doing the planned Santa Cruz move. It will make job-hunting easier, anyway.
<p>
We are parked down in Morgan Hill, moving to south San Jose on Tuesday-- assuming that the place looks decent when we go see it on Sunday (an RV park near where 101 and 880 meet). We're renting a spot for June, and will look for an apt after we figure out when and where we're working. 
<p>
We didn't have too many adventures on the rest of the trip, other than needing new front tires around Phoenix (ouch). It was 110% ugly-hot during all but the last half of the last day of the drive. That last day (Tuesday) started in Blythe at the CA/AZ border and ended one exit north of Pismo Beach, at Avila Hotsprings. A very long run, but after going through the LA basin I just wanted to be Nowhere Near Traffic when we woke up the next morning.
<p>
I also found out that I lost my wireless card in one of the campgrounds (doh!) between here and New Orleans, so I'm just getting to email despite dragging my laptop up to Mt View yesterday in anticipation of a fast download. A friend is loaning me another, and I'll buy a new one later. Spent yesterday afternoon getting the truck re-registered (had it PNO), which required a move permit to smog it. 
<p>
Mike left for the railroad museum, around 1pm. I spent the afternoon updating my resume (minimally touched for the past year or so) and catching up on email. Got our mail today for the first time in about a month and (double doh!) the check I was expecting from an invoice sent April 2nd was not in it. Argh. So, tracked that down and left contact info and a query about it-- not the end of the world, thank goodness, still have some of those nuts and berries set aside. ;-) 
<p>
Thought about going off to Baycon, but will probably wait until tomorrow. I still need to Get Food (and hotel food bites) and do some laundry. And it's almost sunset, argh. Bzzz, bzzz, bzzz!
