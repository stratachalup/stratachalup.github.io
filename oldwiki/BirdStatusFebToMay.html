<p>
Our trip up to Ithaca over the weekend of the 15th was pleasant, despite starting in some pouring rain on the drive northward.  We got a very interesting tour of the Cornell campus by Mike's friend Steve, and then an even more interesting tour of his lab.  Steve and Jill's girls had made cute little place cards for us, welcoming us to dinner at their home, and we felt very at home with their hospitality.  Mike and Steve stayed up very late on Friday night, reconnecting and catching up after many years of very low bandwidth contact.  On Saturday we all toured some local parks (between raindrops) and saw excellent waterfalls.  The girls flew a Powerpuff figure around Mike's head from the back seat of the minivan, and generally had a gigglefest.  I wish my brothers had girls!  Maybe Kevin & Robyn will start with daughters.  
<p>
The girls had a piano recital that afternoon, and Jill was going to be travelling on Sunday, so we decided to head back on Saturday afternoon.  We didn't want to wear out our welcome, and I (Strata) was still very jangled from sending the coach out to the shop and some of the tense discussions that preceded that decision.  I don't always socialize easily, having always been a nerd.  It's hard for me to stay in someone's house if I haven't known them for years, even when they have a wonderful house and are friendly and welcoming.  I've never been good at "immersive visiting", preferring to meet folks for socializing in sessions over a period of days.  Mike and I both worried later that perhaps we had left too abruptly.  We're looking forward to going back for another visit in the late summer or early fall, and it sounded like they would be glad to see us again.  We'd have the coach with us, so we could stay nearby for several days and have multiple visits.
<p>
We returned to a bit of a 3-ring circus going on, with waiting for  our steering box to arrive and trying to get all the tests and referrals straightened out for my Mom's cataract surgery.  The steering box turned out to be both the wrong part and the right part-- it was listed as compatible, but with frame modifications, something that showed up on the vendor's inventory computer but somehow never materialized when we ordered the part. 
Mom got through the surgery with flying colors.  She seems to be doing well despite her usual flagrant disregard for following the post-op instructions.  Well, there's only so much we can do.  I'm just keeping my fingers crossed and saying a prayer now and then.  Of all the things to mess around with, half of your eyesight doesn't seem like a good choice to me.  *sigh*
<p>
Our anniversary was Friday, June 21.  It's a first marriage for
both of us, but we started late-- this is only our 4th.  A mailing-list friend posted the announcement of his 30th today.  I hope
that Mike and I hit our 30th together with enough neurons to celebrate it.  This trip is definitely putting a bit of wear and tear on our relationship, but I think we're learning to make alone time for ourselves in the midst of all of the together time.  A friend joked that we weren't living together 7 by 24, we're living together 8 by 31 (the dimensions of the coach).  Putting the recent chaos of coach repair together with the forced march of getting out of our apartment in time to reach here for the wedding, and the constant time together, I think we're doing pretty well.  We need to do some actual *relaxing* soon, though, or something's gonna pop!
<p>
A pleasant trip to the Catskills this past weekend for<a href="BaitCon.html">BaitCon</a> was somewhat marred
by the lack of our coach.  A borrowed tent performed admirably
in the weekend monsoon.  If that was what weather.com calls a 30%
chance of rain, I'm glad they didn't predict anything more likely.
Sheesh.   On the other hand, the road up Hunter Mountain was 
sufficiently winding that we were very glad we were driving the Echo
instead of the coach.  Several of the 15 MPH curves seemed to have
a tight enough radius that we would have had to cross the yellow 
center line to keep the coach from scraping the guardrails.  Maybe
not.  I'm just glad we didn't have to test that experimentally.
There's definitely no doubt that the overhanging trees on the 
driveway to the lodge were

<h3>Saturday April 20, 2002</h3>
It's only been 4 days since the last update, since it's 7am on Saturday morning right now.  Not as much progress as I'd like, since we're both a bit burned out.  Most of this week has been apt packing for me, with Mike working on electrical troubleshooting on the coach in parallel. Yesterday was the first day that neither of us went to the coach, but ran a couple of errands instead and then did more apartment packing together.  Staying up until 3am on Thursday night might have had something to do with it, too.  I went to the BayLISA meeting, then out to the after-meeting dinner group, and from there back to the coach to help Mike finish up some things.  I'd gotten up at 6am on Thursday, so I was beyond-tired by the time we got to sleep.  Didn't get up until noon on Friday!!
<p>
We took another load of household stuff over to the storage unit on Tuesday, including all our AV stuff except the VCR, which is coming with us.  We have a pretty big load of stuff to take over to St Vincent de Paul to donate.  Need to get that done ASAP, we need the boxes its in to continue packing!  :-)  I've been selling a few things off as well, but mostly larger items like bookcases and such.
<p>
After much wandering, found formica in stock (at a countertop manufacturer, Formatop, in Campbell) that was both color compatible with the coach interior and could be purchased in a cut piece of the size we needed rather than a whole 4x8 sheet. Yay.  The table is still in disassembled pieces, stained and varnished.  We set it up in the coach Thursday without fastening it, and were very happy to see that it will fit nicely.  Now all the pieces are leaning up against the vanity in the back.  We were holding out for a piece of formica, since gluing that in place after the fact would have been really irksome.  
<p>
We're using the little TV from the coach at home.  At least, we would be, except it's back on the coach.  Mike needed it to test his repairs of the Winegard TV antenna and amplifier on the coach.  Some contact cleaner restored the switch to reliability, and Mike re-anchored it in the wall.  Disturbingly, there was a section of the coax cable leading to it that had its insulation completely burned up, down to bare wire!  There's a 2amp fuse on the thing, so Mike put in a 1amp fuse after restringing the coax from the wall mount to the amplifier.  What's worse is that this was probably happening on the return trip with the coach, since the amplifier was reliable for part of the trip and zorched out about halfway back.  There's signs of corrosion there, but not clear where water came in, or if it still comes in.  We've had some heavy rains since the Bird came to roost here in CA, and no sign of water.  Maybe it only gets in when the coach is moving at highway speed in the rain.  Maybe it used to get in and is now fixed-- Mike did some silastic work up on the roof around the base of the antenna.  We'll keep an eye on it.  
<p>
Speaking of the wonderful electrical surprises Mike has found on the coach, we got our 10-pound fire extinguisher refilled this week at a place right down the street from the formica place.  It's an "A B C" type, so we're covered for electrical, engine, or kitchen fires.  We hope never to have to use it, of course.  There's also a tiny extinguisher that lives under the kitchen sink. We'll put that one in the Echo and swap in the slightly larger one that lives in our apartment kitchen right now.
<p>
Mike has the wires pulled through the coach to install the carbon monoxide detector, so that will go in sometime in the coming week.  Given that we have a propane heater in the back bedroom, and that the dinette is right over the generator box, we really want a working CO alarm on the coach!  We were pretty surprised that no one had set one up yet.  
<p>
Various friends have dropped by this week to visit us while we were working on Le Bird.  It's been fun having people over, though with tools strewn around and the interior still ripped up a bit it's not as scenic as I'd have liked.  Oh well!
<p>
<h3>Monday April 15, 2002</h3>
<p>
Frequency of updates increase as procrastination pressure increases.  Must...get...packing....finished....  ;-)
<p>
We're still in "get out of Dodge" mode but progress is being made.   This afternoon and tonight I've been packing up the kitchen, only leaving out the things we're hoping to take with us.  The St Vincent de Paul box is filling up pretty well, too.
<p>
This week is exciting, we're getting the coach clean and finished
enough to start moving things into it.  As we move more things into the coach, we make the apt progressively more unlivable, and then it will all just come together.  I think we might actually get out of here by the end of next week.  Only a MONTH behind schedule, but hey, it's been a big project.   Yesterday while making a metal bracket on which to mount a new vent fan, Mike mentioned it was the first day he hadn't had to crawl under the coach and get greasy.  Yay!  Progress!  I spent part of last night cutting and stapling carpet to the access boards under the bed.  We keep pulling the mattress off the bed to lift up the boards, and the surface of the mattress was getting snagged up from dragging across the wood.  Now it's all carpet (with holes cut for the handle cut-outs on the boards) with staples hammered smooth. 
<p>
As the "keep" vs "store" piles shifted, we realized that we did not have enough easily accessible space for books, and that the dinette was likely to become a space of contention for hobby work surface.  We decided to take one of the forward couches out and 
make a computer table.  We are putting the couch and cushions in storage so that we have the option to put them back in someday.  Amazing construction-- 3/4-inch thick clear surface smooth grade ply, even on the little box that holds the heater up under the couch.  You can't even buy that kind of wood today-- the high-grade 3/4-inch ash or fir that we got to make the table had the usual thick "managed forest" grain. Can't cut 'em down like a cornfield and expect to get the same quality back, but oh well, people never learn.
<p>
The decision to create a table was largely spawned by discovering that the passenger chair will rotate around to face the livingroom area if the couch is removed.  The driver's chair is mounted differently, and doesn't swivel.  We are building the table over the wheel well, and putting 10-inch wide shelves under it along the wall.  The well is actually about 44 inches long, so that's a good amount of shelf space.  It should absorb all the O'Reilly books nicely and be a good technical library.  My fiction paperbacks are going under the vanity in the bedroom, since paperbacks are very narrow. The rest of the forward wheel well will be carpeted and insulated, the better to stretch one's feet out on top of while sitting at the table.  There's just room for one of our standard office chairs between the table and the 3/4 height closet by the door, so we'll have a mini-office setup there.
<p>
Mike stained the wood today, and will varnish tomorrow.  Then we'll assemble it in-place in built-in furniture tradition.  It's all designed to L-bracket together, as well as to the floor, so it should be very sturdy.  We are still hunting matching formica (valley pecan) in a remnant so we won't have to buy a whole sheet. Minton's lumber here in Sunnyvale is wonderful.  They'll cut everything for you for a $5 flat fee, and their table saw & chop box beat our straight edge and scroll saw any day.  They are very much an old-fashioned lumber store, having 5 times the selection of real wood and real tools/fasteners than the chain stores, and in about one-third the space.  
<p>
In other news, I got my stitches out today, and the biopsy said
the thing in my arm was benign.  And there was much rejoicing.
<p>
<h3>Friday April 12, 2002</h3>
More fun, and more delays!  We will definitely be on the road by May 1, but probably not too many days before that. We're aiming for April 25th or 26th.  In addition to all of the other things going on, Strata ended up needing minor outpatient arm surgery.  Being unable to really lift things or use tools for a couple of days was bad timing.  Still waiting on the biopsy, but we don't expect any bad news, as it was small and we got it early (yay for annual exams).  Stitches come out on the 15th or the 18th.  If anyone's looking for a good dermatologist, we recommend Dr Todd Anhalt in Mountain View on Castro Street.  :-)
<p>
The trip back to Raineri was uneventful.  The air hose leak turned out to be that the wrong size hose was used, and they fixed that on the spot.  Kingpin lubrication, which usually needs to be done from the top so that the lube will drip down and penetrate, was done with a pressurized grease gun that makes sure all the space gets filled.  The power steering leak, well, that's still doing a drip or two here and there, but the level never seems to change noticeably so we hope it's ok.  
<p>
All of the propane furnaces turned out to be thoroughly ruined, either by heavy use or mud daubers or both.  The install of the replacement furnace went smoothly at Almaden RV down in San Jose.  Nice folks, and we'd recommend them, especially Larry!  The new furnace is suprisingly quiet-- we had heard that the NT-12 series had a reputation for being "roarers", but perhaps it's because this is a new version of the old model.  The warehouse was out of the new factory-approved vent screens, but Larry assured us that as we head east into dauber territory we will find them in stock somewhere.  They are domed screens that mount on the outside vent panel, and are an easy DIY install.
<p>
Almaden also fixed the LP side of the refrigerator, which ended up being a simple routine cleaning of the burner and sparker assembly.  They were a little surprised we hadn't just done that ourselves given the level of things we tend to tackle.  We explained that we are new to propane and that the manuals gave such dire warnings that we thought we'd let the professionals do it the first time.  All we need to do next time, once a year or if it looks dirty, is use fine steel wool to clean it, and then re-gap it to 3/16 of an inch.  No problem!  
<p>
We had them look at our LP system in general, and found the regulator was still feeding the lines at a pressure of 11 inches wg (water gauge), which is correct.  Tank is sound, all clear for a refill.  We have the horizontally mounted DOT style tank, which is exempt from the new overfill valve regulations.  That's because it already has that type of functionality, standard on the big tanks-- there's a plug you take out, and you fill the tank until you see LP coming out of the plug.  Then you stop, re-plug, and your tank has the necessary 18% headroom.   Even though the shop was hopping, Larry took a few minutes to come out and show us the valves and how they interact, and we appreciate that!
<p>
More pictures coming, but I haven't had time to upload them yet. We pulled the PS forward couch last night, and are discussing putting it in the storage unit and having a small table/cabinet unit built over the wheel well instead.  We'd use one of our office chairs at the far end of the empty space for me.  Mike would use the passenger seat, which we discovered will swivel to face the livingroom area if the couch isn't in the way.  He thinks it's very comfy, I think it has no lumbar support, but to each their own.  :-)  
<p>
Mike spent most of a day on the creeper under the coach, and ultimately emerged with a huge mound of wire and junk which had been the (non-working) security system.  The two enormous speaker horns got donated to RVJ, and the rest of it got dumpstered.  We theorize that a couple of guys named Bubba and Junior must have installed it after a six-pack chugging contest.  The wire types spanned the gamut from speaker wire to coax, each expertly misapplied for the voltage and current load it should have been carrying.  Moby Bird is another 40 pounds lighter, and less "scenic" underneath.
<p>
Also undertaken were repairs on the air horns and the electric horn.  The air horns were largely shot, daubers again, but a couple of them are still serviceable.  The two-note electric horn had one note-horn broken, but a replacement from the auto parts store sounded good (and loud!) and is being permanently wired in today.  We're also pulling a couple of sample screws from the Zip-Dee awning where it attaches to the roof.  Most of those screws are corroded, and a call to Zip-Dee revealed that they ought to have been stainless steel.  It's unclear if the installers did it ages ago or if someone did it more recently. The ordinary steel screws got caught in the corrosive crossfire of the steel roof vs the aluminum awning hardware.  Doh!  Another  trip to OSH is in the works.
<p>
Off to the post office to mail our taxes, which were done days ago, and very capably, by Completax up in Napa.  One of the partners is the mother of my future sister in law, so we knew we'd be in good hands!  
<p>
<h3>Tuesday April 2, 2002</h3>
Are we gone yet?  Not yet!  And probably not until about April 13th.
<p>
Word at Raineri seems to have gone well, and the bird is very quiet now that it has real mufflers.  A couple of loose ends (literally, in the case of one hose) have been found, and it needs to go back to have them corrected:
<UL>
<li> mystery air hose leak in forward center
<li> power steering now has leak where it was tightened (doh)
<p>
</UL>
The past few days we have been pulling the two Suburban NT-12 propane furnaces that we can get at reasonably easily.  The one in the rear under the bed, and the one in the front under the couch are both out, and were found to be completely fouled with mud dauber nests-- fortunately uninhabited.  Mike has spent hours trying to clean them out, but the folks at the appliance repair places say that once the daubers get in, game over man.  Well, we knew we might be replacing several $500 furnaces when we bought it, and that's part of what went into the dickering for price. 
The furnace under the kitchen drawers/stovetop looks like it will be a bear to get out of that space, so we are leaving it alone unless we feel especially brave.  MAYBE it would come out easily if one could get that knob off the gas line.  Hah.
<p>
We are getting one new furnace installed on Friday, we hope, and will make do with that and the catalytic heater.  Or just the one propane furnace if the catalytic's pad looks shot.  We really only need the propane furnaces for boondocking, and between now and May 30 in PA we're not planning on doing a lot of boondocking!  Not more than overnight at a Wal-Mart or something.  We'll put the new furnace in the back, under the bed, so we have a warm place to sleep.  If we were going without hookups, we could run the small cube heater off the generator in the evening to warm up the front of the coach.  With the new reflectix window covers I've made, the coach is pretty darn well insulated.
<p>
We've sealed up with putty the place where external power lines run into the coach, under the front dinette, after finding several dauber nests on the interior wall there.  Ugh.  Daubers squick me.  The coach heater core under that same dinette seat has now been pulled, thanks to Raineri isolating it from the coolant loop as we requested.  One of today's tasks is sealing off the holes in the floor from the loop lines.  Fortunately they look out onto the top of the generator enclosure box, so it's very unlikely that area would get directly splashed by water while driving.  We'll seal the edges of the 1-inch ply that is the floor, and seal or paint the patch board that we'll use to cover the holes.  If I had a hole saw, I'd prefer to make plugs out of scrapwood and glue in the plugs, but we've got some time constraints here and playing New England Craftsperson isn't really compatible, alas.
<p>
Forward DS under-couch now carpeted, and yesterday I tried cutting the panel out from the couch front to give access to the area.  Pththt. A saber saw is just not the right tool for this, especially on wood that thick.  I'm also not tremendously comfortable with power tools in close quarters!  Going back today with a real hand saw, which should be much more the thing.  Peeling back the upholstery fabric on the panel revealed another glimpse of the original truly ghastly fluorescent green shag carpet, and I again silently thanked the owner-minus-two who had the coach redone inside.  
<p>
The huge awkward drawer under the bed has now been nuked, and that space lined with reflectix.  It will get carpeting today, once I go back to Home Despot (did I spell that wrong again? tsk...) and get the right size of staples for the staple gun.   Swingline 800 Heavy-Duty Tacker.  Not a whatever we thought it was yesterday.
<p>

<h3>March 18</h3>
Off today to Raineri Automotive again, with a long<a href="BirdWorkList.html">BirdWorkList</a>.
<p>
<h3>March 17</h3>
Lots of work this weekend, including opening up the front grill so we know it works.  Mike had to square off several screws to get them out with vice grips.  Turns out somebody put in the wrong size/type, and we replaced the bad ones with hex-head machine screws like they were supposed to be originally.
<p>
<h3>March 12</h3>
More tweaking, and ultimately a bad starter relay capwire which was shorting and affecting the spark.  We passed smog, yay!  Go into DMV to get plates, find out that Sunnyvale PD guy didn't fill out form correctly, oh well.  Need to do VIN verification again.
<p>
<h3>March 09, 2002</h3> 
Parked near 183 Acalanes, resting.  ;-)  We might arrange a Fluff Visitation to the Bird, ie I might bring Boo out there and hang out reading or puttering, so she can get used to the rig.  Snark would be too traumatized by the experience, so she'll have to wait.  I know that introducing Boo to it first will interfere with the delicate Alpha Cat - Beta Cat balance between them, but life's tough sometimes.
<p>
<h3>March 08</h3>
Picked up the Bluebird today from Walnut Creek.  The good news is that it runs better than ever, and that in terms of numbers, it passes the smog test.  The bad news is that they couldn't actually give us a smog certificate, because they have to have a manual page or a book to check the engine against to see that it has all the emission control parts.  The guy says that the Clean Air Board  randomly picks smog tests and goes to shops to make them prove they had a manual page to refer to when certifying.  Not only can the shop lose its license, the individual guy running the machine can go to jail.  Sheesh!  
<p>
So we found a shop that claims they can certify it, and have an appt for Wednesday morning.  On Monday, we'll try calling Bluebird in Fort Valley, Georgia, and see if they can fax something to us or to the first shop.  Our shop of choice is Don and John's of Sunnyvale, 408-241-9999, on El Camino near Henderson/Lawrence.  They're real good guys who don't work on giant truck engines, so we had to call Bluebird and find Sam.  Boy we're glad we found Sam...  If Bluebird can help us, we can go back to Don and John's and get it done there after all.  This new shop makes me a little nervous, since the guy kept saying "we'll see what work needs to be done to pass it" and didn't seem to be listening when I said it had already passed on the numbers at Don and John's, all we need is the manual page.  Oh well.  We'll see.
<p>
On the way home, we stopped at the Sunnyvale PD and got an officer to verify the VIN number for the DMV form.  This is our 2nd experience doing this, and this officer was just like the other one, very nice but with no idea how to fill out the form.  The Mountain View officer who verified our school bus's VIN said they don't get any training on these forms.  The Sunnyvale officer said that the CHP got tired of the Sunnyvale PD goofing up the forms and told them to stop filling them out!  He apologized in advance in case it gets bumped back by the DMV.  Oy.  
<p>
We wondered why you have to do this with an out of state vehicle, and learned that taking a vehicle out of state and then back in-state is a method that ripoff artists use to clear a salvage title.  I guess other states don't have the concept of salvage titles, or they're only tracked internally to a state, or something like that  Apparently when an insurance company buys a car, due to totalling, or theft, or what-not, the title is changed to a salvage title.  If your vehicle has one, you can't get it insured or registered in CA.  Wups!  In some cases, it might be a perfectly good car that was written off due to theft and then later recovered.  In many more cases, it is a car that was totalled due to structural damage in an accident, then repaired just enough to look good, taken out of state by ripoff dudes, and brought back in to be resold as a "good" used car.  Double wups.  So the DMV keeps a list of salvage titled VINs, and a DMV employee or peace officer has to verify the VIN of any vehicle brought in from out of state.
<p>
<h3>Feb 28 - March 08</h3>
Getting a tuneup in the amazing hands of Sam at Automotive Maintainance Machine, 199 J. Mayhew Way, Walnut Creek CA 94596, 925-933-5488 Wow!  He got us from truly obscene CO and hydrocarbon levels (6% and 1750) down to CA smog and beyond-- 1.5% and 250.  Huzzah!  Our birdie handled the Sunol grade just fine on the way there, and spectacularly on the way back.  Right out the gate it ran better than it did on the best days of bringing it home.  We took the Sunol at 25 mph, and that was largely an artifact of Mike pulling into the slow lane behind what turned out to be a very lumbering truck.  He had to put on the brakes and then creep up behind it-- the bird probably could have done it at 35 to 40, he thinks.  We're not planning to have kids, but we promised to name a cat after Sam someday. 
<p>
We went to DMV and got the registration going on March 6th, since it was approaching 20 days from when we brought it in-state, and since the TX registration allows only 30 days to transfer.  We still have TX plates, but the DMV lady we talked with said that was ok for now, we are legal and paid-up, and will get CA plates as soon as we pass smog and get the VIN verified.  Since we pay an 8+ percent use tax as good little Californians, we didn't want to go do this until we'd heard from Sam that he got the Bird tuned to pass smog.  If we had to play reindeer games trying to register it via relatives in another state, we'd rather not have already paid into DMV here.  We were careful to make the actual sale price the one that went on the bill of sale, even though it would have been cheaper to register if we hadn't.  The reason?  We have collision and comprehensive on the Bird, and if we had it insured for more than the registered sale price, the insurance company surely wouldn't pay us the difference!  Once we finish doing the additional work to it, we need to adjust our coverage upward, in fact, to provide a more realistic replacement cost that reflects the additional 1 - 3 K we are going to be putting into it.
<p>
<h3>Feb 23 - Feb 28</h3>
Birdie gets moved around Sunnyvale and Mountain View every 72 hours to avoid running afoul of RV parking statues in either city.  You have to move a mile (or was it 3 miles) by the odometer from the last spot and you can't stay (sleep) in the vehicle.   So we leave the front and back curtains open so that any officers checking it out can see the odometer and can see the empty and neatly made bed in the back.  Having TX plates probably helps, too.  I suspect when we get CA plates we might have more trouble with on-street parking.  However we will be in the RV storage yard for most of the remaining time here, so that shouldn't be an issue.  We also left a note on the dash that included our phone number.
