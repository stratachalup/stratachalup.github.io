<p>
Ack, more to put into their proper places, but a quick pass-- just going through the shelves, so there are a handful of juvenile/classic books here too with the fantasy and sci-fi.

<li> Would you believe I didn't know Bradbury wrote scifi?  One of the English books in grade school in which I was reading ahead of class had a short story by him about an immigrant Mexican man living in a boarding house.  ("Goodbye Mrs {whoever}, I see you never!"..."What's wrong?" "I just realized...we'll never see Mr Ramirez again.")  I was so impressed with the clarity and expressiveness of the writing that I looked in the library as soon as I had a free period, and found (to my delight) that most of the Bradbury we had was scifi.

</UL>
<li> Andre Norton
<UL>
<li> Beast Master, and sequel Lord of Thunder

<li> Nothing to do with the awful movie, except the guy has similar animals as his companions.  Sheesh.  Hosteen Storm, a Terran Navajo, has been left homeless along with millions of other veterans of the Xik wars, by the final Xik strike which destroyed Earth.  Now attempting to resettle on another planet, he and his strike team of animals must deal with ancient technology, native hostilities, and post-traumatic stress syndrome.  
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
<li> H Beam Piper
<UL>
<li> Little Fuzzy series (all 3)
<li> Uller Uprising (fell off list a few years ago)
<p>
</UL>
<li> Mary Gentle
<UL>
<li> Golden Witchbreed 
<UL>
<li> I loved this, but if you love it too, do yourself a favor and DON'T read the sequel, Ancient Light, where the author for some inexplicable reason goes enviro-fanatic and trashes down the whole culture she built up.  Wah!
<li> I still want to make an ochmir set and learn to play...
<li> If you love strong female characters, this is a great book for you!
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
<li> Alan Dean Foster
<UL>
<li> Midworld 
<li> Nor Crystal Tears (human/thranx first contact, from thranx viewpoint)
<p>
</UL>
<li> David Brin
<UL>
<li> Startide Rising (one of my most favorite books)
<li> Uplift War (a close second)
<li> Practice Effect (whole nother storyline/universe, but cute)
<li> new galactic series (Brightness Reef, Infinity's Shore, and another one)
<UL>
<li> I really wanted to hear more about the Streaker and her crew, and am disappointed that so much was glossed over.  One incident described in a few pages sounds like a book in itself!
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
<li> Janet Kagan
<UL>
<li> Mirabile
<UL>
<li> A complete delight, short stories in a series.  I want to read more about Mama Jason and Leo, and about this quirky place and society.  I really like the naming convention in the book, where folks are known by their trade as well as family names-- Leonov Bellmaker Denness, Annie Jason Masmajean, Ellie Raiser Roget, Glen Sonics Dollery.  Way cool!  I think I'd be Strata Catalyst Chalup, or maybe Strata Fixer Chalup.  Fixer would probably be a jack-of-all-trades rather than a problem-solver, though.  Anyway...
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
<li> Emma Bull
<UL>
<li> War for the Oaks 
<UL>
<li> I love this book!  A couple of her other books had their moments, but this one I just really, really love and the others were "eh".  BTW, the band she is/was in, Cats Laughing, has an album with some of the songs from the book's band in it!
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
<li> Lloyd Biggle Jr
<UL>
<li> Monument 
<UL>
<li> A great story, in a classic older sci-fi tradition, and more topical today than ever!  A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, only in reverse-- a modern spacer comes to a beautiful unspoiled world, and falls in love with the world and its people.  His wisdom and his kindness win him a place in their society, but as he ages he realizes that if the planet is ever rediscovered, people will try to turn it into a resort world and the society he loves will be doomed.  So he wants to teach them how to prevent this, but he is dying...and now the book really starts.  Yeah!
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
<li> Frank Herbert
<UL>
<li> Dune
<UL>
<li> Formative influence on me.  Scary, huh?
</UL>
<li> Kinda sorta the other two of the first trilogy 
<li> Very occasionally the other other stuff (Chapterhouse Dune and all that)
<UL>
<li> There is a compelling storyline there, namely artificially enhanced evolution, with Leto the Worm Emperor using himself as the ultimate predator on society to force people to evolve so that they won't be easy prey for Outside societies.  Oh wait, I guess now you don't need to wade through them all...
</UL>
<li> House Atreides, House Harkonnen
<UL>
<li> They're not the original Dune, but they're sure not the other ones either.  Interesting backstory/origins, makes me wonder how much is really from Frank Sr's notes and how much was just spun by his son.  Didn't regret the reading!
</UL>
<li> The Dosadi Experiment (also the pseudo-prequel, whose name I forget)
<UL>
<li> A great story of some forced human evolution, and I like very much the Mckee/Gowachin interaction.  I read another one, the first story of how Mckee became certified to practice Gowachin law, but can't recall the name.  I want to dig it out, I liked it a lot.  Gowachin tremble when the Frog God smiles....
</UL>
<li> Whipping Star
<UL>
<li> Maybe Dosadi is the Mckee prequel, and I'm confused, since Mckee is the protagonist of Whipping Star.  Another good, if confusing at times, story from Herbert.
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
<li> Orson Scott Card
<UL>
<li> Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, Children of the Mind
<UL>
<li> Yow... where to start....
</UL>
<li> Alvin Maker series 
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
<hr>
<p>
<h3>6 months - 1 year</h3>
<p>
Orson Scott Card
<UL>
<li> Pastwatch: the Redemption of Christopher Columbus
<UL>
<li> This book is truly amazing to me.  A lot of other Card is on my reading list, but this one is still fresh and most others have faded into a less-frequent cycle (see further below).  Time travel, different cultures, and above all, a close look at what was, and what might have been.  
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
Julian May
<UL>
<li> Pliocene Earth series (Many-colored Land, Golden Torc, Nonborn King, Adversary)
<UL>
<li> A longtime favorite, acquired on a whim in the mid-80's via the science fiction book club (oy vey).  Complex themes of damnation and redemption, amazing ideas, vivid characters.  Suppose you could go through a one-way time gate, to live out the rest of your days in the savage but unspoiled Pliocene earth of primitive beasts and magnificent beauty?  And suppose when you got there, you found an alien race running a feudal society?  Throw in higher mindpowers, and artificial amplification thereof, and you have a heady mix, and an awesome storyline.
</UL>
<li> Galactic Milieu series (Surveillance, Metaconcert, Jack the Bodiless, Diamond Mask, Magnificat)
<UL>
<li> I was thrilled to discover the sequel (prequel?) to the Pliocene series, as it had long been a favorite.  In this series, so many fascinating moral and philosophical questions are wrestled with that one can hardly read it intensely and not be changed by it.  As usual, and even more so than the Pliocene series, I came away feeling supremely ignorant and uneducated-- the quotes, multilingualism, and scholarship in these books is truly outstanding.
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
Sheri S Tepper
<UL>
<li> Raising the Stones
<UL>
<li> All of these books are related, though occurring in highly different times and places.  This one is really my favorite, though Grass is a close second.  Tepper's writing is so informed about people, their motivations, and yet so detailed about alien cultures, even human ones, that I absolutely love these books even though I tend to avoid "people" books.  Religious fanaticism  and how it affects culture is even more strongly themed than usual here.
</UL>
<li> Grass
<UL>
<li> Poor Marjorie Westriding-- she's tried all her life to be "good" but has just been miserable most of the time.  Now she's put in a situation which is so alien and so tense that her usual patterns of behavior are unravelling, and she's well on the road to finding out who she really is and what she really wants.  Of course, between the plague sweeping the known worlds (there is no plague! really!) and the bizarre hostile aliens on Grass, it's unlikely that she'll survive long enough to find out, or to make a difference. 
</UL>
<li> Sideshow
<UL>
<li> A distillation of the human condition, a tribute to diversity gone awry-- a strong yet sometimes confusing storyline which is highly plausible and illustrates vividly the dangers of extremes.
</UL>
<li> Gate to Women's Country
<UL>
<li> I don't really come back to this one, except once in a blue moon (ok, 3 - 5 years), but I'm including it here with the rest. 
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
<h3>12 - 18 months</h3>
<p>
Robin Mckinley
<UL>
<li> The Blue Sword
<UL>
<li> Finding oneself story, simple on the surface, but so vividly and well written that I find it quite compelling. 
</UL>
<li> Beauty
<UL>
<li> Retelling of Beauty and the Beast, done extremely well.  I have yet to read Rose Daughter, which is apparently Robin's second retelling, and different from (and darker than) this one.  This one I like just fine!
</UL>
<li> The Hero & the Crown
<UL>
<li> I liked this less well than the Blue Sword, but still like it well enough to read frequently.  The story of Aerin, who is a mythical heroine by the time of the Blue Sword.  In this book, she's a troubled and troublesome princess-tomboy and sole heir who doesn't seem to be growing into or developing the Gift common to everyone else in the ruling lines.
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
Ardath Mayhar
<UL>
<li> Soul-Singer of Tyrnos
<UL>
<li> Very nifty book, though short, with many very interesting concepts presented in usual Mayhar style-- folks who know about high-tech but choose to live more simply, aliens who manipulate higher dimensions, advanced beings treated as gods, and humans with specially trained abilities that border on the supernatural.  Most importantly, people forging strong friendships in the face of danger.
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
Randall Garrett & Vicki Ann Heydron
<UL>
<li> Gandalara Cycle I (Steel of Raithskar, Glass of Dyskornis, Bronze of Eddarta)
<li> Gandalara Cycle II (Well of Darkness, Search for Ka, Return to Eddarta)
<li> The River Wall (conclusion to Gandalara cycle)
<UL>
<li> The first two are available in paperback as a collection, though I think I've seen them in individual form as well.
<li> Really compelling alien society (or is it?), and wrestling with complex philosophical questions: control of self, control of others, purpose of life.  Nice "alien" interaction with the big intelligent cats, the sha'um, and also with the protagonist, who is somehow a visitor from our world in the body of one of the people of this world.  It takes an outsider to question certain things, and sometimes what "everybody knows" is just plain wrong...
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
Vonda Mac Intyre
<UL>
<li> Dreamsnake 
<UL>
<li> The book-length expansion of her Hugo or Nebula award-winning short story.  In some kind of future, somewhere, wandering healers use genetically engineered venomous snakes to cure certain diseases.  When one healer's alien "dreamsnake", the snake whose bite provides a safe natural anaesthetic, is killed in a tragic misunderstanding, she must find another or give up her profession.  
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
CJ Cherryh
<UL>
<li> 40,000 in Gehenna
<UL>
<li> So you're colonizing a planet.  It has these big, lizardlike life-forms, but I'm sure they're not intelligent.  Really!  ;-) 
</UL>
<li> Downbelow Station
<UL>
<li> Awesome, that's about all I can say; so many threads of interaction: humans and hisa (aliens), military and civilian culture, stationers and merchanters (ship families), Union and Alliance, the Upabove and the Downbelow.... 
</UL>
<li> Serpent's Reach
<UL>
<li> When you're a 15-year old potentially immortal kid of a family which is the only one dealing with the strange, antlike Majat who create most of your society's wealth, what do you do when your whole family is murdered by a rival branch of relatives?  Well, okay, you arrange some revenge, but what about afterward, when you're outlawed?  :-)
<p>
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
<h3>18 - 24 months</h3>
<p>
Robert Shea
<UL>
<li> Zinja series (Time of Dragons, Last of the Zinja)
<p>
</UL>
CJ Cherryh
<UL>
<li> Cyteen (the trilogy) 
<UL>
<li> Brilliant and nasty biotech genius Ariane Emory is murdered, and is cloned.  Little Ari, and the clones of Ariane's bodyguards, grow up guided by her relatives and officers of the planetwide corporation. And, in Ari's case, a very interesting expert system programmed in advance by Ariane, who knew someone might be about to kill her...
</UL>
<li> Pride of Chanur & rest of Chanur series
<UL>
<li> Leonine aliens in a complex multispecies Compact run into a lone human, sole survivor of a human scout team, and the balance of power shifts.  Lead or follow, because there's no "get out of the way" option left.  Told entirely from the viewpoint of the aliens.  Two sequels continue first person from one of the original crew, now in command of her own ship.  
<li> Some nice gender-bending in the series.  Female hani are the engineers, traders, ship personnel, as males are considered too emotional and unstable.  So what happens when you end up with a male as part of the crew, due to some unforseen circumstances? Oh yeah, and the human is male, too-- isn't he a danger to the crew? Imagine, males in space! OK, maybe for uncouth techie species like the mahen, and tricky species like the kif (and who can tell what from what with the stsho), but I mean, really! ;-)
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
Mercedes Lackey
<UL>
<li> Gryphon series (White Gryphon, Silver Gryphon, Black Gryphon)
<UL>
<li> Didn't realize this series was ancient history compared to most of her better-known works. I haven't read much ML, didn't appeal to me.  I've poked at a number of her other books and series, and it just didn't click.
<li> Two mages are battling it out, but this series focuses on the troops, though it's not really a martial or military book (or I probably wouldn't have liked it).  The gryphons, created by the good mage, are doing the best they can to support him, and also coming to grips with the fact that they were created and wonder if they'll survive if he loses...
</UL>
<li> Winds series (I forget the names)
<UL>
<li> Folks have to deal with nasty magic storms that apparently are an offshoot of the conclusion to the (now ancient) magewar that occurred in the Gryphon series.
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
Mary O'Hara
<UL>
<li> Thunderhead
<UL>
<li> Flicka's first colt, and he's a throwback to the Albino! Incredibly complex family dynamics, beautiful descriptions of the rugged hill country, first-person perspectives from all the main characters.  Interestingly enough when I was younger I followed primarily Ken's line through the story, but as I hit my early 30's I followed Nell.  This latest rereading (2001) I found myself following primarily Rob, and some things in the story that had not made as much sense became clear.  When you're wondering if you've been heading in the wrong direction, or at least, A wrong direction for years, it's very interesting to read about someone who is facing the same issues.
</UL>
<li> Green Grass of Wyoming
<UL>
<li> Thunderhead is loose again, and Ken has to finally DEAL with it.  A complication-- this girl whose thoroughbred mare was lost in the hill country and ends up in Thunderhead's band.  She has her own issues to deal with, including being an orphan and having her life pretty much run by her domineering grandmother.
</UL>
<li> My Friend Flicka
<UL>
<li> Never got into this, it's about every 3 - 5 years, but grouping it here with the rest.  Her well-known book, not many folks know there are these two sequels.  I found them in the library in highschool and only realized later "oh, right-- Flicka, isn't that a moderately famous book?!"
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
Louisa May Alcott
<UL>
<li> Little Men
<UL>
<li> Never liked Little Women much, but this has been a favorite for years.  As a kid, obviously, I identified with the boys, but as I've gotten older (and especially now that it's pretty certain I won't ever be a mom) I primarily read it for it's portrayal of Jo.
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
<h3>2 - 3 years</h3>
<p>
Johanna Spiri
<UL>
<li> Heidi
<UL>
<li> Would you believe that this became a favorite because it was the only book I ever read that talked about children and goats? We had goats, and I used to sit out in the pasture with them like Heidi and Peter, though not with any kind of scenery like that!  There is so much to empathize with in this book, at least for me. Lately and most especially, the simple country life that she misses so terribly, even though she is in a "better" place in Frankfort with her cousin. 
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
Keith Laumer
<UL>
<li> Various Retief books
<UL>
<li> They all kind of blend in together after a while, but the fun and the puns are good now and then!
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
Pat Frank
<UL>
<li> Alas, Babylon
<UL>
<li> One quasi-slacker in rural Florida is transformed into a natural leader by a nuclear attack on the USA.  I think there are a lot more bugs and snakes than they mention in the book, but hey, it's fiction.  :-)
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
Larry Niven
<UL>
<li> Ringworld
<li> Ringworld Engineers
<UL>
<li> Actually found this one first, no wonder I was confused. :-)  Still my favorite, prefer it to the original.
</UL>
<li> the new Ringworld book
<UL>
<li> We'll see if it ends up on the rotation; I wasn't thrilled
<p>
</UL>
</UL>
<h3>3+ years</h3>
<p>
Jerry Pournelle & Larry Niven
<UL>
<li> Footfall
<UL>
<li> Aliens invade the earth, but you at least get to see their very interesting culture and viewpoint, as the story switches between humans and the aliens.  A nice change from the usual military/pseudomilitary "stuff" these two write.  
<li> Yeah, I know, what about the Moties?  I just haven't gone back to "Mote in God's Eye", nor bothered to read the sequel, but I went and bought a used copy of Footfall in paperback. Clearly MMV (my mileage varied).
