1. Air brake system:  First inspection of entire air brake system in several years!
a. Rear brake pads are at 25 - 30%, please replace.
b. Clean/replace filter in air compressor.
c. Check compressor, governor, &amp; pressure reservoirs for any needed servicing.  Sometimes when coach is cold and/or there is more than 60 pounds in the system, one must rev the engine repeatedly up to 2500 rpm and/or reduce reservoir pressure so to get compressor to load.  Is this normal/ok?
d. Replace missing cover on rear spring brake (passenger side, I think).
e. Rotate passenger-side outer dually to line up with inner tire valve stem.
f. Opinion of sidewall wear on tires? Tires are all fairly new, but have had some abuse. We have met some curbs while learning to drive and park this coach.

2. Exhaust system:  
a. Replace crunched section of passenger side exhaust pipe (near front axle).
b.   Examine mufflers-- still good? We can patch pinholes ourselves if not too serious.

3.  Transmission:  Routine servicing.  Driveshaft rebalanced recently, is fine.
a. Change filter.
b. Examine fluid, change if needed.  [We have case of Dextron III, will supply.]
        c.  Change cracked and rusted hose between transmission bell housing and tranny cooler.

4. Oil:
a. Oil &amp; oil filter change.   Please use Pennzoil S.A.E. 30 to match previous changes.
b. Locate source of engine oil leak (around intake manifold?).  What is needed to stop leak?  Volume is low, 1 qt every 500 miles, but oil dropping back on hot exhaust pipes is bad.
c. Fluid leak around front steering box?  Please examine.  No loss of power steering
fluid noted in reservoir so far, but we want to know what we're seeing there.

7.  Radiator and Coolant loops:
        a.  Speak with Mike regarding front heater/defroster core loop.  Not currently operational, but looks O.K. other than push/pull control valve inside at driver's seat.  This core is located at front of coach on passenger side, behind front swing-out panel.  Both fans work.  Goal is to have core work for hot air defrosting.
        b.  Replace main radiator thermostat (if present).  Behaves as if stuck open.  In winter temps, engine does not warm up past 135 - 150 degrees.  Summer temps, runs happily at 170 - 180, seems to run better at those temps.  Have seen 200 on grades, or stop-n-go on hot days.
   c.  Examine coolant and replace if needed.
d. We know that overflow pipe has come off on low-pressure side of main radiator fill, just underneath cap.  Unless you have very economical way to fix, we are going to do fix with high-temp epoxy or similar.  Advice welcome.
e. Unfreeze valve to coolant loop that services coach passenger heater cores.  Push-pull cable at driver station. Right now valve is frozen. Would be nice to know if loop is full of junk, but low priority item.  Confirm with Mike before taking any action.
