I have been making stuff like this for a long time, and kind of invent it as I go along.  Recipes here are original unless otherwise specified.  Most ingredients I use are organic-- they just taste better, richer, more complex.  Do what you feel.

<b>Medieval Fig/Bean Pilaf</b><br>
<p>
(I haven't made this one yet, but it's based on a recipe in an SCA cookbook, translated from a medieval cookbook.<br>  The original is a pasty kind of stew, but I think it would be good as a pilaf.)
<p>
<UL>
<li> 2 scoops brown rice
<li> 1 scoop baby lima beans (soak 2 days, refrigerated)
<li> 5 - 6 dried figs, cut into quarters (remove stem)
<li> 1.5 T rubbed sage
<li> 1 T whole mustard seed
<li> .25 tsp whole coriander
<li> .25 tsp whole white peppercorns
<li> small bay leaf
<li> .25 tsp thyme

<li> .25 tsp salt

<b>Forest Pea Soup</b><br>
<p>
Invented 10/2/00, loosely based on Split Pea Soup recipe in "The Vegetarian Soup Cookbook".  <br>
<p>
Really needs longer simmering to soften the split peas to a smooth mush.  The rice cooker basically has two settings, "warm" and "boil", so the split peas came out having some texture.  We kinda liked that, but you might not.
<p>
<UL>
<li> 1 scoop green split peas
<li> 1 scoop yellow split peas
<li> 1 can "no-beef" veggie broth 
<li> 4 cans water
<li> 4 - 6 dried figs, whole
<li> 2 medium carrots, sliced thin
<li> .5 large onion, or 1 medium onion, diced
<li> 2 stalks celery, sliced thin
<li> .5 huge or 1 medium sweet potato, quartered & sliced thin
<li> .25 tsp bay leaf, or 2 large bay leaves
<li> 1 tsp oregano
<li> 1 tsp thyme
<li> 1 tsp basil
<li> .5 - .75 tsp salt
<p>
<p>
</UL>
<b>Indian Pasta Casserole</b><br>
<p>
Not really a rice cooker thing, though I suppose it could be made in the rice cooker.  I really just need to put up a House Wiki for my home and put stuff like this in it.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<UL>
<li> 1 package Tinkyada Rice Spirals
<li> 1 package frozen chopped broccoli
<li> 1 can cooked chickpeas
<li> 2 cans sliced mushrooms (small cans)
<li> 1 jar "Calcutta Simmer Sauce", Marsala flavor
<p>
</UL>
Cook the pasta until just al dente, then add the package of frozen broccoli (break it up) and the chickpeas.  Let the mixture come back to a simmer for a minute or so, then drain; this finishes cooking the pasta, and softens the chickpeas (which are often quite chewy even precooked).  Drain liquid from mushrooms and add them.  Mix in the sauce.  Ta-dah.  Very quick to make, tastes good, looks good, reheats really well.  Good with shredded cheese on top also, but don't add cheese to the recipe, it just gets stringy and gloopy.<br>
<p>

<b>Two-Minute Minestrone Soup</b>
<p>
The purists will scoff, yet it is very good for something that is easy to make when you get home at 11pm from work and just want to eat and go to sleep.<br>
<p>
<p>
<UL>
<li> 1 can veggie "no-beef" dark broth
<li> 1 can cooked chickpeas
<li> 1 can cooked kidney beans
<li> OR-- 2 cans "mixed soup beans" (I like Hanes Organic)
<li> 1 cup good spaghetti sauce
<li> 1 pkg frozen chopped broccoli
<li> 4 c cooked rice pasta
<li> bay leaf
<li> 2 - 5 white peppercorns
<li> .5 tsp whole mustard seed
<li> 1 tsp rubbed sage
<li> .5 tsp celery salt
<p>
</UL>
[For Ten-Minute Minestrone, take .5 c each of chopped celery and chopped onion, and saute them in olive oil at low heat until translucent, along with the spices.  This makes the whole thing vastly better.]
<p>
Combine all liquid ingredients [and sauteed things, if you have done so] in a large pot, including the draining the liquid from the canned beans (essential!).  Bring to a simmer to let the flavors mix, then add the frozen broccoli.  You may, of course, thaw it.  Bring to a simmer again, then add the remaining ingredients (the beans, the sauce, the cooked pasta).  Simmer as long as you can stand not to eat it-- the chickpeas need softening up.
<p>
Observant readers will note that it takes about 10 minutes to make the two minute version, and about 15 minutes to make the ten minute version.  Yes, it's true, but the elapsed time always seems shorter, so the names are indicative of the effort.

<b>Gumbo Limbo</b>
<p>
Makes a big potful, for 4 - 5 hungry folks or dinner plus a couple of days lunches; gets even better sitting in the fridge. Of course you can substitute frozen ingredients for fresh, etc etc.  This recipe is specifically tweaked for us: no pork (both), no beef (mike), no shellfish (me, trying to get back on the kosher wagon).  It probably tastes better with more of the "real things" that we're leaving out, and could be just as easy to make.  Anyway-- onward!
<ul>
<li>8 C water
<li>half pkg Zatarain's Gumbo mix ('cause we're wimps)
<li>1/2 C brown rice
<li>dash of powdered file' (optional, adds flavor)
<li>half pkg frozen lima beans
<li>half pkg frozen chopped okra
<li>half pkg/big link turkey polska kielbasa sausage, sliced up bite-size with kitchen shears
<li>full pkg of fake krab lumps (with artificial flavor only for us)
</ul>
<p>
Toss everything except the krab lumps into the rice cooker and press the button.  Wow, that was easy!  Add the krab lumps about 10 - 15 minutes before you're going to serve it, as they make a nicer contrast when they don't simmer a long time and totally blend in.
<p>
If you're like me and keep the ingredients in the freezer, toss the kielbasa in the cooker with the water while you're gathering the other ingredients.  By the time you've opened the other bags, it will be soft enough to cut with kitchen shears.  If the krab is frozen, put it into a bowl of warm water on the counter to thaw, or throw it into the gumbo frozen and stir once or twice to break up the chunks
