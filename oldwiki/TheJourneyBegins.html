Depart Cowtown RV Park ($25, -10% SKP discount, must identify as SKP at time of reservation) around 1pm, after a nice chat with the fulltimer lady working the front desk.  Mike has similar chat with the owner, a fellow ham.  Mike spotted the antennas on a building here as soon as it got light, and the fellow wandered into the office as he was asking about them when we checked out.
I start, and update, a "ship's log" at breakfast time, as already the days are starting to blur together!
<p>
We stop a few exits down to gas up the Bird, and I walk across the street to Whataburger, a local chain.  Nice place, nice atmosphere, but burger is only "ok" despite being cooked fresh on demand.  Oh well.  Nice little timewarp kind of place, though, with polite highschool kids working the counter and their friends hanging out at the tables.  
<p>
We drive a couple of hours, then trade off at a rest stop.  Mike does great, despite his understandable flinch reaction to the big rigs.  Swoosh!  A wall of truck that LOOKS about 6 inches away even though it's 4 - 6 feet from you.  Oh yah.  Mike takes us to full dark, and copes wonderfully with the little service roads as we get lost finding East Suburban RV Park ($15, includes cable TV).  My bad, wrong exit.  We call the owner, who graciously waits for us, since winter hours seem to be 7pm here rather than the 8pm in Woodall's Guide.  
<p>
We pull in at 7:30ish, phew, good to be off the road.  We wrassle with the tow bar, and finally unhitch.  It's 9pm by now, so after a brief nearby tour of options we end up at the local Denny's.  The smalltown Denny's are usually pretty good, since real people can afford to work there.  This one was no exception.  We had a brief moment of terror (our Daily Scare) when we couldn't find my Toyota keys upon pulling in, but they turned up in Mike's pocket from earlier.  Phew.  We hooked up the cable, watched a little TV-- fascinating look at the building of and problems of the Kansai (artificial) Island airport off Kobe Japan.
<p>
<b>Thurs Feb 14</b><br>
Up at 9am or so, ready to head out at 11am.  Big problem getting up the overpass to get back on the highway.  The bus stalled, pouring out black smoke--- oh no!!! Mike was following behind in the car, since we had only a short way to go, approximately 50 miles to the CAF Air museum in Midland TX.  No power on the hill, restarted the bus and crept up in first gear.  The next several miles were completely awful, creeping along a gradual climb at 20 and then 15 miles per hour with the flashers going.  Mike was saying we needed to pull over and get off the road, but we tried to think of a way to get more power.  Checking the choke and throttle, we realized that the manual choke was still out from the startup process.  DOH!  I pushed it in, and the bus immediately picked up about 50 percent.  Over the next 45 - 50 miles, she gradually came back to something resembling normal, though still more sluggish on hills than previously.  We were sure we'd fouled the plugs permanently, but they gradually cleared over time.  
<p>
Mike realized later that we were probably doing this exact same thing in microcosm on a daily basis when we idled the engine for 20 - 30 minutes upon starting every day.  We were following the instructions of the previous owner, who probably got them from the one before.  Also, his mechanic had convinced him to switch to premium gas at some point, which was certainly richer than lowball unleaded.  The bus usually handled sluggishly until about 15 - 20 miles down the road, whereupon she would "wake up" for the day.  Aha.  No more long morning idles for us.
<p>
Saw the CAF museum, and lots of good stuff.  We hitched up in the parking lot to test the towing-- the morning's Daily Scare had us wondering if towing would overburden the Bird.  No problem, the power seemed better, and kept improving during the drive to our next stop, Country Coach RV Park in Monahans TX.  This was a gravel park with lots of pull-through spaces, way outside of town though only a few miles off the highway.  We met a nice SKP lady, Rosemary, who was on her way back to Kansas City with her hubby, who unfortunately was having some health problems.  Mike ended up chatting with the hubby, whose name I didn't catch, the next day while doing the Daily Dump.  This involves long corrugated plastic hoses and rubber gloves, rather than a tar command, and we'll leave this part of RVing a vague mystery to the uninitiated.  It's actually a quick and clean process if you do it carefully and have good hoses.  No Black Water Bath Specials, please.  So far, so good (on the whole trip!), knock on wood for later.
<p>
We unhitched the car and went to the local supermarket equivalent for supplies.  I cleaned out the RV freezer with Fantastic anti-bacterial and would now trust it.  ;-)  We had been using the onboard icemaker to generate fresh ice for our cooler up to this point, and wanted to switch to running the fridge/freezer all the time now.  We watched a little History Channel, Atlantis "Mystery History" which Strata found amusing, and something on Nazi warbird developments which Mike thought was well-researched, given that it had some aviation history of that era that he didn't already know.  
<p>
We were awakened by STRONG winds slamming the coach at about 6am, and watched the local news to discover they were 30 mph and not atypical of weather out here.  Yeesh.  Also tuned to 167.55 and heard the little computerized NOAA voice tell us their weather info.  
<p>
<b>Friday Feb 15</b><br>
Midland TX to El Paso TX; Mission Park RV   Started what will undoubtedly become a tradition, making biscuits in the toaster oven.  Life's simple pleasures.   
<p>
Mike dumped the tanks, and discovered the grey-water valve handle missing.  Where did it go?  Who knows?  There's also a slight leak around the valve pipe to tank connection, which we now realize shows signs of previous repair.  At least it's only grey water.  A very tiny leak, and the valve is easily manipulated with channel locks for now.  We picked up a replacement valve handle later in the trip, but haven't installed it yet.
<p>
Checking our battery water, Mike finds it low, and tops it off.  It's good to check once a week or so.  He also makes us a real connector for the tow lights on the Echo, no more electrical tape kludges.  We make a reservation for El Paso, and need to get going.  Gas is at a quarter tank, so we refill at the local gas station and take on 73 gallons.  The tank is listed as a 150 gallon tank, but the previous owner thinks it's 100 gallons.  We need to get down there and measure and then we'll know for sure!
<p>
Strata drives for the first 2.5 hours, then we stop at a rest stop for lunch.  Mike takes over or the last 3 hours.  We arrive at the last bit of light, wow!  This is the first time we've pulled into an RV park without needing a flashlight to hook up.  We get connected, then go do laundry onsite.  Mike finished the laundry while Strata finishes an overdue article for publication, then gets email.  We catch the last half hour of the jacuzzi and indoor pool before they close it for the night.  We cook dinner and watch a little TV, a Biography Channel special on Hugh Hefner.  Bizarre, but fascinating.  We also call in a prescription to the local Walgreen's (handy, that!).  Sometime during the day, Critter Care called us back and we extended our Fluff & Plant care through the 20th.
<p>
<b>Sat Feb 16</b><br>
El Paso TX to Deming NM; Faywood Hot Springs  Up at 8:30am, and call several RV parks in Deming.  We weren't sure if we wanted to stay at the SKP park and day trip to Faywood, or stay at Faywood.  Since the SKP park turned out not to take reservations (doh!) and Faywood did, that made it an easy choice.  We got a late start out, checking out just in time at 11am and stopping to get one last email fix at the front desk visitor phone station.  Used the campground showers to parallel process this morning while Mike used our RV shower.  Nice place here (Mission RV Park), very clean and well kept!
<p>
We went for groceries to the Walmart super center several miles outside town, then saw one later that was easy-off, easy-on from I-10.  Oh well.  We should have left sooner-- the nearly empty side lot where we had parked filled up almost completely during the time we were inside.  Lots of folks come over from Ciudad de Juarez across the international bridge, since Walmart has decent stuff at decent prices, despite its foibles.  We picked up groceries and miscellaneous, including a new sewer hose and some fittings.  We like to fix things before a disaster happens, rather than after.  We filled up at a nearby gas station, and discovered we had gotten unusually lousy mileage yesterday.   Both of us were pushing the coach a little harder than usual, in the 60 - 65 mph range instead of where it likes to be at 57 mph or so.  We also climbed many many miles of 1 - 2 percent grades coming out of the Permian Basin from Monahan to El Paso.  
<p>
We found the Walgreens for my prescription after a wrong turn or two, and had our Daily Scare in the parking lot.  Today it was a cup or so of coolant overflowing onto the asphalt below us, dribbling out and then slowing to a few drops.  After various overreactions, soul-searching, and maybe a moment of terror or two, we cautiously got on the road again.  We discovered that the bus seems to like running at about 170 or so in these warmer climes.  It has been consistently running at 135 to 150 previously, which is probably a bit cold for it.  The thermostat has not been replaced or serviced in years, according to the logs and shop records in our binder.  We ended up with a bit more power, some better pickup, and a running temp of about 175, even after some sustained grades.  
<p>
Bob had admitted to filling both the coolant and oil on the bird to a level of "well, probably a bit overfull".  Now that we were in warmer conditions, the coolant was adjusting itself out the overflow tube.  The bird, alas, doesn't have an overflow catch basin, just a tube.  We may try to modify that.  Stopping and starting as we did errands around town probably caused us to run hotter than we intended, also.  We had no other coolant incidents when we stopped to swap drivers.  The oil leak has stopped also, at least the gratuitous drip version.  We now show between "full" and "add 1", which would work out to be about a quart every 800 miles or so.  That's not bad for a 1976 engine, especially a huge one like this.  The oil leak was our Daily Scare during the last Sunday and Monday in Dallas.
<p>
Many windy twisty dirt roads up to the office and RV area at Faywood.  Yeek!  In retrospect, we ought to have unhitched the toad, but oh well.  It's very rustic, and we got the one pull through site that was the least level.  Mike got to drag out the levelling boards, probably original, that came with the coach and store across the undercarriage behind the rear driver's side bay.  We got ourselves "mostly" level and that was good enough.  
<p>
We spent several hours up at the pools this evening.  They have 3 sets of pools.  One area is for the RV & camping guests only, and  then there are two areas for both RV and day-use guests.  One is clothing optional, the other is bathing suits required.  We found a number of congenial folks soaking up in the public pools, and chatted for quite a while.  Topics ranged from cars and their peculiarities and mechanical habits, a topic near and dear to our hearts on this trip, to fishing in back-country areas, to railroads and rails to trails programs.  Several of the folks had grown up in the areas between Deming and El Paso, and had stories of riding now-defunct rail lines to school or to work.  
<p>
We heard a rather startling story about freight rail coming out of El Paso.  Apparently the trains have to go up a very long grade, and are moving at only a few miles per hour for an extended period.  Actual banditos from Mexico, in pickup trucks rather than on horses, come and rob the train. They will come alongside the rail cars, and climb out of the back of the truck up onto the train while their accomplices keep driving.  They pry up boxcar doors or slash the wrappings off flatbed cargo, and heave boxes into the trucks.  Then they flee for the border, only a few miles away.  Armed Union Pacific security guards and even the Border Patrol have mounted expeditions to stop them, but so far several lives have been lost in running gun battles.  Even though the trains continue to beef up security, the freight consists are so long that there are plenty of under-protected sections-- they can't be everywhere at once.  A wild tale, more out of 1892 than of 2002!
