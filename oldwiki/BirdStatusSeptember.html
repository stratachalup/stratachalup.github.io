<b>Sept 3 - Sept 10 or so</b><br>
(Tuesday) Coach move day-- back to Hemlock Grove, closer to Seashore and several dollars
cheaper.  Not a nice marsh/bay view, but a nice forested site.  Mike went off to Seashore
and I did some cleaning, some reading, some Quality Puff Time, making Boo & Snark 
very happy.  They got to run in and out a bit, got some grooming, and Boo got to sit
on my back and purr while I lay down reading a book.  Everybody's happy!  ;-)  Nice sale
on salmon (now that the tourists are gone?), which Mike cooked for us.  
<p>
(Wednesday) Chasing the "Blab" internet cafe in Ogunquit, which turns out to be closed.  
Wasn't listed in the usual places, found out by accident from a guy who was in the 
shop while I was logged in the other night.  Closed for the day?
For the season?  For the local arts festival, which won't be over until it's time for us
to leave?  Who knows-- will try to find out tomorrow.  Stopped at the Canon factory
outlet and wished I could ship stuff back to our storage unit-- some great deals
there.  Got a queen size good quality polarfleece blanket for $19.99, and a nice
acrylic one for $22.  The individual Coleman fleece sleeping bag liners that we use,
laid flat on the bed, just aren't hefty enough on cold nights.  Adding one of the down
sleeping bags on top is too much on most nights, and we'd like more choices than
"freeze" or "roast".  A light comforter from the local Ames-going-out-of-business
store completes the set, and now we should be able to deal with more climate options.
<p>
In the evening, 
Mike went with Donald to a classical organ concert in Methuen MA, and had a great time.  
I needed to try to finish my article, but I hadn't been able to do all the research 
required to avoid feeling like an idjit and potentially putting my foot in it.  I
ended up doing some work on the article, and doing a major reorganization of the coach
interior, mostly moving books to the forward closet and closet-y things to the kneewell
in the vanity.  It's a bad idea to have much weight behind the rear wheels; loads should
be concentrated above and between the axles.  Lately books had been building up in the
back, as flea markets, an old Amazon gift certificate, and random hard-to-find things from
museum and attraction stores were taking their toll.  Now things that we don't get at
very often like extra hats and Mike's warmwind jacket, etc are in a big clear storage bag
there.  This also clears clutter, especially paper-based clutter, out of the way of the
airflow of the rear propane heater.  We may not need it today, but if we stay in the 
New England, NY, or PA area for more than another week or two, we'll want to fire it up
at night.
<p>
(Thursday) Woke up at around 6am and decided to get up.  I'd really *like* to be
getting up at dawn and going to sleep around 10pm, but it doesn't happen consistently.
To be more specific, every time we either stay near friends, or have a cable TV hookup
at the campsite, we shift into 8:30ish - midnight:30ish mode.  Bah.  Now doing a biiig
update at the shop at Seashore.  Got some earplugs in, since they're banging metal today!
<p>
I stayed online for far too long, then headed into the library where I got online again
and checked out some more books.  I'd forgotten that getting up at 6am would leave me
famished by 2pm, my usual lunch-type time, so I stopped by Mike's Clam Shack again.
As the Furby would say, "yuuuummmm!"  Yeah, I shouldn't, but yeah, I do.  Deal.  :-)
Stopped at various farmstands to get goodies for the holiday.
<p>
(Friday)  Today was a writing and kitchen-puttering day.  I'd been trying
to figure out when we could have Mike's mentor, Donald, over for dinner.  I decided
to get the holiday baking done, and at least make some extra.  I hoped to bring a 
mini-loaf of banana bread over to him when I picked up Mike.  As it turned out, he
gave Mike a ride back, and didn't have other plans so he let us talk him into 
staying for dinner.  I had made chicken stew with lots of fresh farmstand veggies,
thought I didn't use quite enough cornstarch for thickener and it came out more
soupy than stewy.  Still tasted great, though.  The little toaster oven made me
3 mini-loaves of banana bread (*had* to use those 2 bananas!) and a big loaf of
my traditional Rosh Hashanah apple/almond/honey/spice bread.  I mash up a couple
of apples, add slivered almonds and pumpkin pie spice plus cardomom, and decorate
the top with whole almonds.  Yum!  Had to pull out the grinder for the first time
in a few thousand miles, since I was out of rice flour.   I need to get a small
sifter, whether I have room for one or not, since spending a half hour hand sifting
rice flour through a wire mesh strainer is not something I want to repeat.
<p>
(Saturday)  Drove up to Portland to attend services at Temple Beth El, a conservative
shul in South Portland.  Mike said it reminded him of his home congregation in Long
Island, albeit many years ago.  They are in phase one of a several-phase expansion
process, and construction barriers were all around the area.  I still prefer a much
smaller congregation, with lay leaders rather than a rabbi and cantor.  These folks 
seemed very nice, but didn't socialize the way a congregation usually would with new
faces.  Probably due to all the transients who come in for the High Holidays-- they
might assume that someone they don't recognize came with someone else.  Oh well.
<p>
I had an interesting idea regarding the Akiedah, which I discussed with Mike.  It
revolves around the identity of the speaker to Abraham-- note that one source speaks
before the trip, and a different one speaks to intervene.  I have a theory as to
why this is, which is probably heretical, but a question I think that should be 
explored.  There are some things I just don't take for granted, not being born to
all this and not encountering the Bible particularly until late adulthood.
<p>
We spent the remainder of the day resting quietly at home, as befits the holiday.
We let the puffs out since we were home, and of course zillions of buggies came in
the open door.  Got to do something about a screen door, grr.
<p>
(Sunday) Mike went off to the Museum, and I came along to borrow another cup of bits.
Chatted with some folks-- the shop sure bustles on Sunday!  We had talked about going
to second-day RH services, since the shofar wasn't blown yesterday (Shabbat & RH on
the same day).  Forgetting to set the alarm clock kind of decided that one, which is
admittedly lame.  
<p>
I rigged a makeshift screen "door" with some of the tulle left over from making my 
lavender sachets.  I simply doubled it over a pressure bar wedged in the doorway,
leaving the lower 6 - 8 inches of the door open for the cats.  Voila, instant screen
door.  It worked quite well.  
<p>
I cleaned the water tank today, as the last fill was a few weeks ago.  We tasted
the water and didn't like it, although there was no visible change in appearance.
I had been waiting to do it until it was time to turn & rotate the mattress, since
one has to remove that to get at the tank under the bed.  
I had to get the last bit of water out of the tank by bailing through the top ports.
Then I used a clean dry towel to sop it clean and swab down the roof and sides 
of the tank.  We had opened the drain valve earlier and let it gradually drain out
from 1/3 full to empty.  Yes, I remembered to close the valve before I refilled it! :-)
<p>
I feel like I kind of woke up today, and started thinking about why we came on this
trip.  Some of the things we wanted to do, we have done.  Others, we haven't yet
attempted.  One of those other things is to find a couple of small plots of land
to buy, one out here in New England somewhere and one elsewhere.   I started making
a list of things I'd like to spend the next couple of weeks accomplishing, and
another list of modifications to the RV to better support boondocking.  Since we
spend an average of $150/week on camping, we can calculate the payback time of
certain modifications quite easily.  We're currently scheduled to leave on Wednesday
morning, but I'm going to talk to Mike about staying longer and this other agenda 
of mine.
<p>
<p>
(Monday)  This would normally be Mike's day off from the Museum, but since Saturday was
Rosh Hashanah, he's coming in today.  I came in too, to try to help them with some 
computer problems up in the office.  Seems like simple miscommunication/misconfig stuff,
and I was able to set things to rights very easily.  They have some underlying issues
that need to be resolved, but it's nothing that one person can put a bandaid on.  The
folks doing the gift shop need some specialized support for the point of sale system.
Meanwhile, the rest of the office is slowly being updated and has its own agenda.  Coming
from a sysadmin background, I was not about to rearrange things on the office net to
suit the lone (albeit vocal) stakeholder from the gift shop.  Their regular admin is
only onsite sporadically, since he's a volunteer and has a regular job.  Wups.  
<p>
I am at the library, updating this and preparing to get online.  I checked out Red Apple
campground on the way over.  They're a tiny bit cheaper than Hemlock Grove, since their
nightly price includes tax.  They don't include cable, though, and I'm sure they don't
include a newspaper.  On the other hand, no cable might get us to bed earlier at night!
We'll see.
<p>
(Tuesday)  I've been having fun with the toaster oven.  I didn't bake much at the
apartment since CA is so hot so much of the time, and our apartment got very warm
during the day even in wintertime (no roof insulation, 2nd floor apt).  I should have
bought a toaster oven when we lived there!  It warms up in minutes, and then cools down
fast after you're done.  The one I got will fit 3 mini-loaf pans side by side or one
midsize loaf pan.  Some pans I tried were too large due to the handle extrusions on the
ends of the pan.  I recommend taking the broiler tray from the toaster oven into the
stores with you when looking for baking pans!  I also picked up a 6-inch round cake pan,
sold by Wilton as part of their cake decorating bakeware.  It's intended to be a top layer
on a layer cake, but it fits in my toaster oven and will be just right for cake for 2
with a couple of leftovers.  I haven't used the cake pan yet.  
<p>
Today I made blueberry bread.   Measuring out the
dry ingredients is a pain, so I started a baggie for quick breads.  I label a ziplock
bag and put a batch of stuff in it so I can just pour it in next time: rice flour,
potato starch flour, salt, xanthan gum, baking powder, baking soda.  I don't add the
sugar, since I use varying amounts depending on what is going into the quickbread--
1/4 - 1/3 cup for blueberries, 1/4 c for date-nut, 1/3 c for banana, etc.  Sometimes
it works better to cream the sugar with butter or olive oil, too, so that's another
reason not to add it.   Soon I'll have to 
grind some more brown rice flour in the little Kitchen-Aid mill.  It's finally
earning its keep again after travelling several thousand miles!
<p>
I took the little Toyota to its appointment for servicing-- 17,500 miles on the
odometer.  Towing miles don't show up, so it's really had an additional 3.5K miles
on the frame car and tires.  They were overdue for rotation, and we were starting
to feel it in the ride.  Saco Toyota did a great job, and were very speedy as 
well.  I stopped at the RV place across the street to get a new wheel chock, ours
having fallen victim to an oops while setting up the levelling boards last week.
<p>
There was also a comicbook store in the same plaza.  
I did a minor comics renaissance after not following any for many years.  
An online review of comics, in mailing list form, helped me hook up with new
titles.  I think it was called something like "Comics worth reading" and it
was by Joan or Jo-Anna or similar.  I eventually unsubbed in an effort to cut down
on email, and because most comics now cost $3.95 - $5.95 per issue, which is
getting kind of ridiculous.  There's some kind of ongoing magazine collection
of comics called Edge that I saw in this comics store, which is a $9.95 monthly
that looked interesting.  It was only moderately gory, had a fantasy theme,
and had good color and artwork.  Unfortunately it picked up in mid-storyline
of the series that it followed.  Picking up the collections or individual
issues to find out what has led up to this point would have been *very*
spendy-- one series alone had only back-issue collections at $20/ea, and there
were 4 to go through before catching up.  No thanks!  While I can't really justify 
the expense of following more than a couple of titles, I am eagerly awaiting
the new Girl Genius (Phil & Katja Foglio, you rock!).  Castle Waiting volume 2 is 
apparently FINALLY out, but they were out of it.  Interestingly enough, they've
republished volume 1 and it has a slightly different cover than my older version.
Mine is titled "Lucky Road" at the bottom of the cover page, whereas the newer 
one says simply "Volume One".  May there be many more volumes!  
<p>
My other favorite title, Amy Unbounded, was recently collected into book form
and issued as a "mainstream" release.  I hope that this means that the author 
will start publishing new stories soon.  I ordered everything she had at one 
point, all self-published format. The "latest" issue was over a year old back 
then (at least 6 - 9 months ago).  It's a great storyline
about a girl growing up in medieval times.  There's some fantasy element in it,
most notably the dragons and Amy's mom.  The dragons, who of course bring in
a fantasy element merely by existing, are scholarly types who can take human
form in order to do field anthropology.  Amy's mom is rather more of a fantasy
element, in that she is a foreigner from a tribe of Amazonian-type women.  There's
nothing supernatural about her.  The fantasy element is her well-accepted presence 
as the wife of a weaver on the outskirts of a small rural town.   Aside from one 
or two shouted insults by (inebriated?) townsfolk, she is completely accepted.
Actual medieval towns would have been rather less forgiving of a strong, domineering 
foreign woman, especially one whose trade, clock-making, is decidedly not one 
traditionally practiced by women.
<p>
<PRE>
 I was following Bone for a long time,
</PRE>
but the storyline has really gotten bogged down lately and it doesn't seem to 
be worth getting in the individual issues.  I'll wait until the next (last?)
collection comes out and finish the story then.  I was also following Usagi
Yojimbo, but haven't picked that up in a while.  In part I've forgotten which issue
I left off with, but also in part I'll just wait for the next collection.  While
the collections are smaller and don't include the wonderful color covers, they're
an easier format to shelve and enjoy later.  OK, I'm a comics philistine.  But I
knew that.
<p>
I had really enjoyed the Finder collection titled "King of the Cats", 
but examining earlier and later collections, and asking friends, leads me
to believe it's not typical of the series.  The next storyline in particular seems
to be very very dark, and I am so incredibly tired of that in comics.  In the early
and mid-90's I avidly followed Sandman and Hellblazer/Constantine, but they just
kept going further and further into gruesome territory.  They finally ended up as
"horror" comics rather than "fantasy" comics as far as I'm concerned, so I punted.
It's too bad, the ideas in some of them were so stunning-- the family of the Endless,
Lucifer closing up Hell and opening a nightclub as a "private citizen", etc.  But
the endless stream of gratuitous gore finally got too grotesque.  I liked the start
of the Books of Magic series, but it grew morbid in the same direction and the
"magic" moments of philosophy or wonder became fewer and fewer.  Bah.  
<p>
(Wednesday) I don't remember much about Wednesday, except being grumpy because I
wanted to go out and explore with Mike rather than doing whatever it is that I
did instead.  :-)
<p>
(Thursday) This was a "me & Mike day".  We didn't do a whole lot-- the day
started out a bit rough as we had one of those deep soul-searching 
discussions that are part of the High Holidays and introspection.  Later
we went down to Wells to the linens outlet store to try to find a replacement
flannel fitted sheet for the one that finally died of old age.  Nothing there
in the right size except dark gray (ugh) and screaming yellow (double ugh).  
They had some nice quality flannel sets, but we didn't like the colors of most
and wanted to just replace the bottom sheet of the set we have.  
<p>
We stopped in at the Wells National Marine Estuary reserve and had a nice walk
for about 2 hours.  The various trails went from meadow to forest to beach,
and returned along boardwalks through marshy deciduous woodlands.  We could have
hiked for much longer, but chose a combination of trails that looped back to
the visitors' center and gave a variety of scenery.  We had only two encounters
with wildlife, per se-- saw some gulls at the beach, including one with a flatfish
too big for him to swallow and lots of others trying to figure out how to get some
for themselve.  On the driveway back up to the parking lot, Mike found a little snake
laying on the pavement.  I caught it and we found it to be either an Eastern corn
snake or a grey rat snake.  It had gorgeous rust-red corn snake type markings on a 
medium grey background.  It was a recent hatchling, about 1.5 times as long as
a new pencil and of similar diameter.  Very very very cute! We released him on
a small sandy patch at the edge of the lawn, and he (or she) quickly threaded off
into the grass.  I didn't want to find him in our tire treads after we left!
<p>
We ended up the day with dinner out at China Hut, a self-proclaimed Chinese & 
Polynesian place on Rt 1 right at the Biddeford/Saco border.  It had looked
like a bit of a dive, but when we tried it before (late on a Sunday night with
few other options) we had found it to be excellent.  Leftovers for lunch
tomorrow-- yum!
<p>
(Friday) I got up at 6am and baked cranberry nut bread.  Hmm, I need to chop 
both the cranberries and the nuts (pecans) into finer pieces for it to work 
better, but it was still good.  Friday the 13th strikes, but I didn't know 
it *was* Friday the 13th at the time.  I tried following the signs I'd seen
for the past several weeks to the "Country Kitchen Discount Store" and 
couldn't find one-- I'd hoped to get some real mini-loaf pans rather than
the disposable tinfoil ones I'd been washing out each time. 
A check of policies at the Walmart pharmacy revealed that we wouldn't be 
able to use an automated phone system to order our prescriptions at new
Walmarts while travelling, the way we can currently with Walgreens.  They
don't share computer systems between the Walmarts in the same way, so we'd
have to bring in the bottle(s) and wait for the transfer.  Bzzt.  Dr. Lisgar's 
office didn't respond in any fashion about the singulair prescription,
despite it being 6 business days since I left the message with the (live)
receptionist-- no voicemail, no prescription, no word.  Turns out the office
is closed until Tuesday morning, and I remembered to call after it closed
today.  I didn't get to log in while at the library, since I didn't realize
that it closed at 5pm on Friday and did other things first.  I spent a couple
of hours reading the 2001 Writers Market and copying down possibles for
articles.  I'm doing so much writing while on this trip that it wouldn't
hurt to try to sell some of it.  :-)   I had parked across the street from
the library to read the paper while eating my rather late (2:30pm) lunch.
If I'd realized it closed so soon, I would have been much less leisurely
about it.  
<p>
Speaking of lunch, I have to GOT get back on the kashruth wagon. 
This trip has to be a nadir in terms of my observance.  Fastfood cheeseburgers
on the road and in the busy times before we left CA, New England style split
pea soup with ham, peking ravioli (dumplings) at Mary Chung's, fried clams & 
scallops, lobster rolls, a BLT with fresh farmstand tomatoes.  Argh.  
The clam shack!  On the bridge!  The only insanely great fried
clams in the universe-- all others I've tried so far are simply "ok". Maybe when
we leave here I can quit this fried clam habit.  Every other week is still too
much.
<p>
I got back to the coach at about 5:30 and realized I wasn't sure what on
earth to make for dinner.  I decided to experiment with mushroom barley soup,
having a bunch of mushrooms on hand and having stopped for more at Patton's
Berry Farm on the way home from the library.  I ended up with more of a barley
stew, being a novice at how much barley can expand (boy howdy!).  It turned out
great, though.  Donald dropped Mike off from the museum, and I invited him
in for cranberry bread and dinner.  He couldn't stay for dins, but had a nice
visit munching with Mike while I finished chopping veggies for the barley soup.
I managed to finish up in time to visit a bit too.
<p>
(Saturday)  Boo & Snark were curled up like little pretzels
together on the couch this morning.  It was so cute!  I wish
I could have gotten a picture, but the camera was in the
overhead bin right over them, and I'm sure Snark would have 
fled if I'd tried to get it.  
<p>
Mike is off to the Museum again, and I'm on the porch here at the
campground, where they have a modem jack on the payphone.  I have
been using the library to dial up but they are only open 9am - noon
on Saturdays.  The museum shop is too busy on weekends to log in
from there, at least in the mid-day.  Both our backs are starting
to go out, so we have a chiropractor appt on Wednesday, the first
available at the local one.  Ouch.  The mobile RV service van
is also going to come by on Wednesday and check out our propane
furnace.  Mike is sure that at least one of the wires needs 
replacing due to that snafu with it being grounded to the brakes.
Unfortunately, the CA place that installed it won't do a thing
for us, since they can't see the problem.  They weren't even
interested in seeing a picture, and the shop manager denies that
one of his guys would have done that.  Grrr.  Might try writing
a letter to Suburban, the furnace mfr itself, but I don't know.
At least having this local shop do it won't void the warranty
like it would if Mike and I took the furnace out to do it.
<p>
I talked to Mike, and he's going to only volunteer 3 or 4 days
a week for the next couple weeks so that we can do some things
together.  We really haven't done many tourist-type things 
together, and now things are starting to close since it's after
Labor Day.
<p>
I mostly loafed for the rest of the day, getting online for a while
and then reading.  I'm trying to get back into a routine of doing
some daily Torah study, even if it's only a little.  The 365-chapter
volume "Jewish Values" by Joseph Telushkin is designed for this,
giving a brief lesson from Talmudic sources.  The days of the week
even match up with the days starting from Rosh Hashanah this year--
nice coincidence!  I also read a bit of Torah from the Hirsch edition
which we brought with us, as well as starting again at the beginning
of the "Talmudic Anthology", a volume of excerpts and sayings.
<p>
Toward evening I decided I'd better get busy, and started cooking.
I made chocolate pudding (easy in the microwave) and did chocolate
raspberry cups with the berries I got yesterday.  I also cleaned and
bagged the quart of blueberries into small bags and put them in the
freezer.  More blueberry bread is in our future.  The real project
was the cabbage rolls.  
<p>
I had never made them, but I had been longing for cabbage rolls since
having some really great ones at the deli near Mike's folks in NY.  They
had mediocre beef ones, but truly awesome turkey ones, and I wanted
to try to re-create the latter.  I had saved some big outer leaves from
the cabbage we had last week, and gotten some ground turkey, but
I hadn't realized I didn't have any kind of recipe from which to work. 
Time to wing it!  I mixed chopped onion, mustard seed, bells seasoning, 
paprika, salt, pepper, and raw brown rice in with the ground turkey. 
The rolling up went tolerably well, into the raw, washed cabbage leaves.
I secured them with a toothpick, two in some cases.  I had put a thin
layer of olive oil at the bottom of the rice cooker so they wouldn't
stick, even though it's non-stick.  I added currants to the first layer
of rolls, then put in the 2nd layer.  Add one can of tomato paste
to a pot of water, mix ves of banana bread (*had* to use those 2 bananas!) and a big loaf of
my traditional Rosh Hashanah apple/almond/honey/spice bread.  I mash up a couple
of apples, add slivered almonds and pumpkin pie spice plus cardomom, and decorate
the top with whole almonds.  Yum!  Had to pull out the grinder for the first time
in a few thousand miles, since I was out of rice flour.   I need to get a small
sifter, whether I have room for one or not, since spending a half hour hand sifting
rice flour through a wire mesh strainer is not something I want to repeat.
<p>
(Saturday)  Drove up to Portland to attend services at Temple Beth El, a conservative
