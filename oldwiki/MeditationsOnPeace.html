<b>excerpt from the Metta Sutra, the "Teaching on Loving-Kindness"</b>
<pre>
The following is an excerpt from the "Metta Sutra," or 
the "Teaching on Loving-Kindness." Hearing it today gave 
me a great sense of peace, so I thought I would share it, 
in case anyone else found it refreshing as well.
<p>
<p>
May all beings be at ease. 
Whatever living beings there may be; 
Whether they are weak or strong, omitting none, 
The great or the mighty, medium, short or small...
Those living near and far away... 
May all beings be at ease! 
<p>
Let none deceive another, or despise any being in any way 
Let none through anger or ill-will wish harm upon another. 
<p>
Even as a mother protects with her life her child, her only child, 
So with a boundless heart should one cherish all living beings; 
Radiating kindness over the entire world: Spreading upwards to the skies, 
And downwards to the depths; Outwards and unbounded, 
Freed from hatred and ill-will.

<b>excerpt from the writings of Lao Tzu (mari)</b>

Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu
Translated by Charles Muller
<p>
Weapons are the tools of violence;
all decent men detest them.
<p>
Weapons are the tools of fear;
a decent man will avoid them
except in the direst necessity
and, if compelled, will use them
only with the utmost restraint.
<p>
Peace is his highest value.
If the peace has been shattered,
how can he be content?
<p>
His enemies are not demons,
but human beings like himself.
He doesn't wish them personal harm.
<p>
Nor does he rejoice in victory.
How could he rejoice in victory
and delight in the slaughter of men?
<p>
He enters a battle gravely,
with sorrow and with great compassion,
as if he were attending a funeral.

<b>Rest In Peace, Thich Nhat Hanh (paul)</b>

                  REST IN PEACE
</PRE>
(by Vietnamese Buddhist monk, Thich Nhat Hanh)
<p>
<PRE>
 I am a World Trade Center tower, standing tall in the clear blue sky,
 feeling a violent blow in my side, and
 I am a towering inferno of pain and suffering imploding upon myself and
 collapsing to the ground.
 May I rest in peace.
<p>
 I am a terrified passenger on a hijacked airplane not knowing where we
 are going or that I am riding on fuel tanks that will be instruments of
 death, and 
 I am a worker arriving at my office not knowing that in just a moment my
 future will be obliterated.
 May I rest in peace.
<p>
 I am a pigeon in the plaza between the two towers eating crumbs from
 someone's breakfast when fire rains down on me from the skies, and
 I am a bed of flowers admired daily by thousands of tourists now buried
 under five stories of rubble.
 May I rest in peace.
<p>
 I am a firefighter sent into dark corridors of smoke and debris on a
 mission of mercy only to have it collapse around me, and
 I am a rescue worker risking my life to save lives who is very aware
 that I may not make it out alive.
 May I rest in peace.
<p>
 I am a survivor who has fled down the stairs and out of the building to
 safety who knows that nothing will ever be the same in my soul again,  and
 I am a doctor in a hospital treating patients burned from head to toe
 who knows that these horrible images will remain in my mind forever.
 May I know peace. 
<p>
 I am a tourist in Times Square looking up at the giant TV screens
 thinking I'm seeing a disaster movie as I watch the Twin Towers crash to
 the ground, and 
 I am a New York woman sending e-mails to friends and family letting them
 know that I am safe.
 May I know peace. 
<p>
 I am a piece of paper that was on someone's desk this morning and now
 I'm debris scattered by the wind across lower Manhattan, and
 I am a stone in the graveyard at Trinity Church covered with soot from
 the buildings that once stood proudly above me, death meeting death.
 May I rest in peace.
<p>
 I am a dog sniffing in the rubble for signs of life, doing my best to be
 of service, and 
 I am a blood donor waiting in line to make a simple but very needed
 contribution for the victims.
 May I know peace. 
<p>
 I am a resident in an apartment in downtown New York who has been forced
 to evacuate my home, and
 I am a resident in an apartment uptown who has walked 100 blocks home in
 a stream of other refugees.
 May I know peace. 
<p>
 I am a family member who has just learned that someone I love has died, and
 I am a pastor who must comfort someone who has suffered a heart-breaking
 loss. 
 May I know peace. 
<p>
 I am a loyal American who feels violated and vows to stand behind any
 military action it takes to wipe terrorists off the face of the earth, and
 I am a loyal American who feels violated and worries that people who
 look and sound like me are all going to be blamed for this tragedy.
 May I know peace. 
<p>
 I am a frightened city dweller who wonders whether I'll ever feel safe
 in a skyscraper again, and
 I am a pilot who wonders whether there will ever be a way to make the
 skies truly safe. 
 May I know peace. 
<p>
 I am the owner of a small store with five employees that has been put
 out of business by this tragedy, and
 I am an executive in a multinational corporation who is concerned about
 the cost of doing business in a terrorized world.
 May I know peace. 
<p>
 I am a visitor to New York City who purchases postcards of the World
 Trade Center Twin Towers that are no more, and
 I am a television reporter trying to put into words the terrible things
 I have seen. 
 May I know peace. 
<p>
 I am a boy in New Jersey waiting for a father who will never come home, and
 I am a boy in a faraway country rejoicing in the streets of my village
 because someone has hurt the hated Americans.
 May I know peace. 
<p>
 I am a general talking into the microphones about how we must stop
 the terrorist cowards who have perpetrated this heinous crime, and
 I am an intelligence officer trying to discern how such a thing could
 have happened on American soil, and
 I am a city official trying to find ways to alleviate the suffering of my
 people. 
 May I know peace. 
<p>
 I am a terrorist whose hatred for America knows no limit and I am
 willing to die to prove it, and
 I am a terrorist sympathizer standing with all the enemies of American
 capitalism and imperialism, and
 I am a master strategist for a terrorist group who planned this
 abomination. 
 My heart is not yet capable of openness, tolerance, and loving.
 May I know peace. 
<p>
 I am a citizen of the world glued to my television set, fighting back my
 rage and despair at these horrible events, and
 I am a person of faith struggling to forgive the unforgivable, praying
 for the consolation of those who have lost loved ones, calling upon the
 merciful beneficence of God/Yahweh/Allah/Spirit/Higher Power.
 May I know peace. 
<p>
 I am a child of God who believes that we are all children of God and we
 are all part of each other.
 May we all know peace.
