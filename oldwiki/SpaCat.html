<p>
Most really nice outdoor hotspring resorts or spas seem to have one or more cats around.  These cats are almost always HUGE and completely oblivious to people.  Sometimes they are friendly, but more often they are so used to being petted or fussed over that they just ignore you!  
<p>
Still, ignoring people and being Sphinx-like is what cats tend to do best, and we salute the Giant Spa Cats of the world.  Despite being feline, they make a place more human, and thus more humane.  Strata
