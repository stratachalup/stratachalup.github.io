<b>Monday Aug 25 - Tues Sep 3</b><br>
<p>
(Monday) Allegedly our day off, but we had a coach to move.  Had an easy trip in to Sea-Vu in
Wells, with no traffic lossage other than an over-eager truck that tried to cut us off.  We both
get tense when we move the coach, and unfortunately had a bit of a snarl-fest but it all cleared
up by the time we started driving and the rest of the day went well.  It was too late in the
day to do anything complicated by the time we got settled into our spot-- a gorgeous view of
the saltmarsh and Wells Harbor, ours by virtue of a late cancellation on someone's part.  The
folks next door came over and chatted with us for a couple of hours, with Mike and the guy
trading info on which roads and grades to choose/avoid in various locations, and myself and
the woman swapping campground info.  Fun and informative-- now we know a couple of good places
to go in Florida, and what *not* to do as we get closer to the cities there.  We set out at
around 4pm to drive down to Wells Harbor, and had a nice sunset walk on the beach.  I met a 
couple of nice little Shelties, and there were many other dogs around.  Local ordinance says
no dogs on the beach before 6pm, so everyone was out walking in the sunset. 
<p>
We saw a woman pulling a wagon with a toddler, and holding
a well-behaved Great Dane on a lead.  We both wondered why she didn't have the dog pulling the
wagon.  :-)  It was all black, and very graceful, and we had actually seen this trio in a
nearby store about an hour earlier.  I was very surprised by how dramatic the dog looked
out in the open on the beach.  In the close aisles and clutter of the store, it was merely
another large object, viewed close up from the top downward.  From a hundred yards away,
in silhouette, it was uncannily large and graceful, looking more like a deer than a dog.
I wondered if it might have been a Dane cross with some large sighthound, since I'd noticed
in the store that its head wasn't as blocky and jowly as a typical Dane.  I was just fascinated
with this dog-- it seemed to me that it had stepped off an old Celtic or Roman frieze, and
I watched it for quite some time.
<p>
Sunsets on the East coast beaches are something of a disappointment to me, after having lived on
the West coast for so many years.  I had never spent much time around the ocean while living out
here in New England for my first 28 summers, so I had no real experience with sunset beach walks
on the Atlantic.  It's no surprise when you think about the celestial mechanics, but I hadn't
thought about that-- New England beaches become dark, grey, and misty at sunset.  Instead of 
that warm golden and pink light coming across the sand, a line of mist comes up from the
surf and the boundaries between shore and sea begin to blur.  Gulls are dark grey specks
against a gray backdrop, and blackness, not blueness, reigns distant on the horizon.  
<p>
(Tuesday) A quiet day at the coach, with Mike taking the car in to the Museum.  There's a local
"trolley" service, ie buses that have been tarted up to look like trolley cars.  Mike calls them
Abominations, and starts sounding like a bible-belt preacher when he gets going.  They're a good
source of transport, though, so I didn't need the car.  As it turns out, I spent the day catching
up on reading, spoiling the cats, and generally mellowing out.  I took a walk at sunset, and then
Mike came home, cleaned up, and we went off to meet his friend Donald.  Donald is a retired
orchestral musician (bassoon) who heads the restoration shop effort at Seashore, and a really
charming guy.  There is a series of summer concerts celebrating the restoration of the 90
year old Kotzschmar organ in downtown Portland, and we caught a ride with Donald to attend
the latest one.  We'd missed the Birthday celebration the previous week, alas.  The program
was excellent, though it seemed to take the organist, a visitor from Memphis, the first few
pieces to hit her stride.  An enjoyable evening, capped off by some necroferroequinology
on the way home, visiting the Portland narrow-gauge and some other bits of rail in our path.

<b> New update</b><br>
(Wednesday) Went into the Museum with Mike to borrow a cup of bits-- there's a line in
the shop.  Caught up on email and updates, huzzah.  Dropped into Kennebunkport and 
snagged some scallops at Mike's Clam Shack on the bridge, recommended by the Roadfood
Guide.  Best fried clams I ever had, brought some back to my Mike last week.  Yum. 
The library was having a booksale, and I picked up some interesting things, all a dollar
or less.  Turns out you can get a library card for a $15 deposit which is refunded when
you return the card-- very nice!  They also have 4 workstations and, allegedly, a laptop
connector in the other building where the booksale books were located.  I was short on
cash and not carrying checks, so I will come back tomorrow and get a card, and check
out that phantom connector.  I need to do some research for my next login article, so
that would be great.  
<p>
Did a few drives around for farmstands, found a very nice one, Sunflower Farms--
organic veggies, cut flowers, and a friendly guy who liked chatting about veggies.
Turns out that a couple of the fingerling potato varietals he had were ones I'd
read about in an Atlantic article.  His seed stock had come from Wood Prarie Farms, 
a provider of organic seed potatoes. (www.woodprarie.com)  I got some of his
Russian Banana to try, and picked up a few of the old reliable Yukon Gold.  Closer
to home, Shadey Stop was a little umbrella farmstand on Route 1 about a block past
Log Cabin Road.  Got some great blueberries there, and wonderful vine-ripe tomatoes.
<p>
(Thursday) Kennebunkport Library, and the parable of no internet access.  More later,
but suffice it to say that discretion is the better part of valor.  After hearing
from several people that there was a laptop jack in the library (somewhere!), I met
up with a Japanese gentleman who was trying to get online.  He needed a phone jack,
I needed a network jack.  No one knew where the public jack was, or whether it was
a phone or a network jack.  Sheesh.  He tried what I'd thought about-- unplugging
one of the public machines temporarily during his timeslot and substituting his
laptop.  Fwoosh! Someone came around and had a severe, albeit polite, hissy fit
at him, and I felt sorry for the poor guy.  Could have been me!  It was clear that
no one had briefed the library staff or volunteers about the computer systems and
what could or couldn't be done with them.  Everyone was afraid of being
responsible if something went wrong.  I stopped
by Goose Beach at 6pm, when parking is ok w/o a permit.  Drove past it out of curiosity
down to the right hand side, bought two brownies (one for Mike) and a lemonade from
kids running a stand out front of their house.  Their mom came out and watched-- good
mom!
<p>
(Friday)  I felt like I wasted Friday, and now I can't remember what I wasted it
doing.  A lot of driving, I know that.  Either today or yesterday that I went too far
on Rt 9, stopped and walked at the boat ramp.  Bought a goose beach parking permit,
which I probably won't get to use since now it is raining and rain predicted for much
of next week, bah.  Well, they need it badly here, so I won't grudge it.  
That might have been yesterday, I haven't done daily updates, tsk tsk.
Ate at the Maine Diner, which was very good in spite of the numerous signs inside
talking about how it was featured on this or that TV show and/or magazine.  We figured
that the number of cars there at every hour was a good sign, and caught it with only a
minimal line.
<p>
(Saturday)  Member's Day at Seashore.  I helped Mike scrape some paint on the car
he's been working on.  I tackled some detail work with rolled up bits of sandpaper
and a small special tool, removing a thin line of old paint around the rivets.  I
got up to 41 rivets and a few window lines after a couple hours, then ran out of 
interest and energy.  Every little bit helps, though.  Rode the City of Manchester
parlor car, and got some nice shots of the interior detailing.  Was somewhat 
marooned on the 434, since they stop it for long intervals between moves.  It
has a pair of 300 amp motors, and that's about the max that they can run on their
overheads until the new substation is finished.  So everything else stops for the
434, and then it stops for everything else.  Yeesh.  Nice restoration, though!
I also got to ride the Montreal breezer car, and took a pic or two while it was
out in the nice sunshine.  The day got quite warm, and I set up my lawn chair
in the shade near the restoration shop so I could read while Mike did some more
paint sanding.  
<p>
There was a Tony Hillerman novel was out at the library, Western Wind or
similar title; I found it pretty good but lacking more in characterization than some
of the others.  It featured both Leaphorn and Chee, but was more focused around
Leaphorn while not really advancing his character much.  I didn't learn anything
about him that I didn't know already from earlier books.  
<p>
(Sunday) We slept in, for a change-- nice! We made a long drive down to NH for the annual
Hopkinton State Fair, since we'll be out of the area when the Deerfield Fair rolls around.
I used to attend both, to do the 4H dairy goat shows.  Hopkinton hasn't changed much,
though I'd forgotten the old trick of ignoring the road signs and getting off onto 127
at exit 6 rather than 103 at exit 7.  We sat in traffic for half an hour covering the mile
to get from the road to the first parking lot, argh.  I last dropped into Hopkinton, or
maybe Deerfield, in the late 80's, and still found some folks who remembered my parents
or the Newtons or the Jenks from the old 4H goat club.  This time, those were distant
legends to the folks I spoke with, and there were some decidedly new features on the
scene: a goat "costume" show, and various Pack Goat classes including showmanship
and obstacle course.  Yow!  
<p>
I had never heard of goat packing-- no smart comments here, gang.  ;-)  
Some nice exhibits showed how wethers (altered male goats,
for my city slicker friends) make excellent trail companions, treating humans as part
of their own herd, having a similar walking pace, and being able to carry 30 - 50
pounds on a pack frame.  In areas that aren't subject to conservation constraints, a
goat can also browse for most of its forage needs, having similar feeding habits to deer.
A discreet note on the list of advantages also mentioned that what goats leave behind
is largely indistinguishable from that left by deer, in sharp contrast to horses or
ponies.   A goat packframe looks like a pair of X's with padded load
straps that rest on the goat's back while it is strapped in place.  Panniers are hung
over the frame.  I wish I had gotten a photo of a goat rigged up for pack, but I'm not
sure I caught one-- I did get a shot of the exhibit poster, though.  
<p>
One thing that interested me was the change over the years in both the mix of goat breeds
being shown and the conformation of the animals.  Our family teamed up with some like-minded
families in other parts of the state to found the first dairy goat club in NH.  Together we
introduced dairy goats as an exhibit and show animal to the various NH fairs, including
Hopkinton, Deerfield, Rochester, and a few others.  The usual 4H classes in showmanship and
conformation expanded quickly to kid, yearling, first freshening, and mature doe classes.
At the time we moved to Maine, following the 1977 fair season, there were also Open classes
at the larger fairs in NH and Massachussetts.  All of the 5 then-extant breed categories were
represented, each in its own class: Toggenberg, Saanen, Alpine, Nubian, and La Mancha.   
(At the time, Oberhasli was not yet being recognized as a distinct breed.)  There were also
classes for recorded grades, and I don't recall if they were mingled or done according to the
breed in which they were recorded.  Several farms not affiliated with 4H came to
the open classes, as well as youngsters from the usual group attending the 4H set.  Over 
the 6 years we were part of this community, prior to our move several hundred miles north,
we saw a steady improvement in the quality of the stock amongst all the farms.  
<p>
Folks would
start out with the usual rangy, ridgebacked, "draggin' bag" type of mutt goat that had lousy
udder construction but could milk almost a gallon a day.  Several upbreedings later, they
would have a nice, well-sprung dairy type doe with good rear and side attachment and maybe
more front pocket than you'd like to see, but overall a several hundred percent improvement
in udder and a slight overall improvement in milk production.  The Jenks' willingness to
bring in good quality Togg bucks from places like Pennsylvania and Ohio did a lot to
improve that breedstock in NH, as did lines introduced by the Newtons and by (argh, name
failure-- the couple whose wife was a registered nurse, and who claimed they hadn't gone
grey yet at 35 because they were waiting until later to start a family).  The breed mix
was about 50% Toggs, lots of Alpines, some Saanens, and here and there a Nubian or La Mancha,
probably 50-30-10-5-5.  Fast-forward to 2002, and we see a mix that looks like 50% Alpines,
20% Toggs, 20% La Manchas, a few Nubians and one or two Saanens.  Hmm!  I also saw a lot
of recorded grades with that typical grade conformation, and few purebreds with what
conformation quality that looked like what we had normalized back in the late 70's.  I'm
guessing that all the stock with which I was familiar had basically dispersed and the
bloodlines have been lost or blended.  That's the way of the world, but what a pity!
We had some really great lines going in central NH back then!
<p>
We visited the petting farm, and I got to pet an alpaca and find out why folks make such
a fuss about their fiber vs llamas.  Big difference!  We spent some time talking with a
lady at the llama tent, and found that llamas are just starting to take off in NH.  Unlike
alpacas, there aren't any socialization issues with raising the young crias-- they know they're
llamas, and aren't going to try to treat humans as rivals or potential mates.  This is in
sharp contrast to alpacas, who make adorable friendly darlings until their hormones kick in
at 1 - 1.5 years old, at which point they become little monsters and occasionally dangerous
to handlers.    An unproven female of good but not superstar breedstock goes for $1500 - $4K
in NH, and a male for less.  They're at the "information tent" stage at fairs there, and
I didn't see an actual llama breed class on the program, though I could have missed it.  There
isn't currently a 4H club for them in NH as far as I could find out, though there were at
least two Maine clubs represented at the Acton fair.  Interesting!  We saw a fairly large
herd of llamas at pasture on the drive to Hopkinton, and I wonder if they might have
belonged to the lady to whom we were speaking.    When hers started groaning (literally,
it's a noise they make when irritated) she mentioned that they only had to do this once
a year, since she rotated in new animals each day of the fair.  So they got no sympathy,
despite their big velvet eyes and fluffy ears.  Awww...  This lady had some brochures out
for Shaker village in Canterbury NH.  They have some great mini-classes and demos, from 
building Shaker furniture to broom and brush making, and a special textiles/fiber day with
spinning and weaving demos.  Alas, we'll miss them this year.  Maybe next year!
<p>
We had an interesting diversion on the way to the fair.  The route we took passed
right by the turnoff to our old house at Chichester, so we took a side trip to find
the old house.  The hayfield across from the school was now a little subdivision of
houses, wooded and unrecognizable.  The school itself had major construction going
on all around it, with a new wing extension and some kind of major levelling thing
going up the (old) hillside where we used to play kickball.  The only way to recognize
Deer Meadow Road was that it was the only road right next to the school, so down it
we went and found the house.  Location was the key, since it looked completely 
different but was still right across from the state highway sheds where the salt and
gravel is stored.  Even those had changed, with a couple of new sheds replacing the old
tarped piles.  The little evergreens we planted that had grown about 6 - 7 feet tall
when we moved are now full sized trees and hide the house from the road.  Our lilac
bush is still by the side of the driveway, and the driveway/lawn border in front has
been shored up with large chunks of rock where it was eroding.  Was that lilac one we
transplanted from Grammy's in Concord, or was it there already?  The big pine tree
in the half-circle formed by the driveway was still there, but it was nothing but a 
huge trunk with stubs. The second pine was gone with no trace.  
<p>
We had a nice chat with couple living there and got to go inside the
downstairs and also walk around the back.  It turns out that the son of the next
door neighbors is living next door, and that house looks mostly like it did when
I was growing up.  One change-- the big pine tree between the property border is
now a huge pine tree like the one on our lawn used to be.  There's only been one 
owner between us and them (we think), but he made a lot of changes and the interior 
was unrecognizable.  They're really interested in pictures from when we lived there,
and I said I'd try to find some.  I didn't get their email address, but gave them a
card and we'll see if they email me.
<p>
The panelled beams in the living room had been replaced with "rough-hewn" facing and
stained very dark.  There's a woodstove there now, and a chimney and firepad.  There
are all sorts of interesting artifacts hanging on the walls, since the lady of the 
house is an avid Civil War re-enactment fan, and also an equestrian member of the
Governer's Guard.  In fact, when we arrived onsite, she was shining up her tack in
preparation for escorting the governor at an event the next day.  The kitchen had
reverted to its pre-renovation state, and looked much as it did before my Mom 
had it redone in 73ish.  The previous owner had moved the wall inward from the
stairs, which were now open-step, and removed the access from the foot of the stairs
to the kitchen.  The new folks are thinking of pushing the kitchen wall back into the
backyard to make the place bigger.  Mom's kitchen island and big cabinets were gone,
too, and it looked very cramped in there, with not much counter space!
<p>
There still was no upstairs heat, though they say it gets very warm up there now from
the woodstove.  The central heating grate in the livingroom entry was gone, and so was
the door down to the cellar!  That is part of the motivation for expanding the kitchen,
having access to the cellar without having to go outside.  They'd go beyond the current
outside shed doors (now plywood, and in bad shape-- hadn't Dad had replaced them 
with metal at some point?).  The porch still had the gray paint on the floor, wearing
through to the old red paint!  The house itself was yellow, and they were intrigued
to hear it was red when we had it, since that was their second choice.  The previous
owner between us had done it in gray.  
<p>
The front barn was torn down, as well as the shed in between.  The other folks had
built a garage taking the place of the shed, and these folks extended it to about the
same footprint as the old barn, with 3 bays for autos and stairs going up the far right
corner just like the old one.  What's funny is that they never *saw* the old one!  The
new garage is shorter than the old one, you can see the marks on the roofline of the
porch.  They also moved the porch steps from the side/driveway where we had them to 
the "front", ie on the same side as the outside door (now missing the concrete steps
we had on that door).  They cut through the daylilies, which are still there, and
were putting in new steps.  They claim that they found "old" steps under the porch
and that they're putting them *back* where they were before.  They were very interested
to hear that the location they had covered over is where the steps always were when
we lived there.  The big island structure Dad had built on the porch to hold toys,
games, and outdoor misc was gone, no sign of it.  They filled in the two big concrete
pits on the side of the front barn, and you'd never know they'd been there.  We thought
they were old mechanics pits from a garage, or gas tank pits, and they were full of
rubble, junk, and hornets nests when I grew up there.  Dad pulled some interesting
tools and parts out of them on occasion.  The brick-ring garden with nasturtiums
and gladiolas out by the side of the house was gone, alas.
<p>
Out back, all the sheds had been moved to the far back side, near where the mule's
metal house had been.  The barn had been converted to open plan by the previous owner,
who raised rabbits, and had been converted again to horse-stalls by the new owners. 
They were very interested to hear that we had built the barn.  The original roof lasted
all this time, they just reshingled it.  They asked if we had multicolored shingles,
and I recall that we did since we could get an odd lot cheaper than getting them all
the same kind.  I remember being up on the roof helping Dad do the hayloft, and also
doing some of the shingling, as a kid.  Scared of heights now, but those were the good
old days!  I think I still have the tea ball that I used to use in my cup back then.
The whole front of the barn has been fenced in, and they have what looks like two paddocks
there, all churned up-- pigs maybe, in the past?  They have expanded/replaced our old
fence on the side of the barn, and someone got rid of the rockpile.  Down back by the
wells, they've set up equestrian rings with obstacles and jumps.   Their vegetable
garden is where ours was, and they do a pretty good-sized one, all the length of the 
backyard like we did. 
<p>
(Monday) Star Trek marathon on Sci-Fi Channel.  Go in with Mike to log in. Internet cafe
in Ogonquit? Hmm.  Guy asks to use laptop, should have thought to say it's like asking
someone you just met to borrow their car for a few minutes for $5.  Sheesh. 
Read Kiln People by David Brin.  Chat with Mike about epistomology and other madness--
purpose of life?  pththt.  eastern merge vs western individualism, etc  Did we eat at
the Maine Diner today again, or was that yesterday?  I'm really getting fuzzy...
