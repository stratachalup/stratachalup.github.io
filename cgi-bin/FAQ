Q: I would like to make the pages append only.  Is AtisWiki set up for this?

A: 

No, but it is very easy to add: you only need to change the file "AtisWiki" 
(the main cgi-script) a litle bit:

1) sub actionEdit
      

change

                        -default=>$page{text},


to
                        -default=>'',



2) sub actionPost  

change

 $page{text}   = $string;

to

 $page{text}   = "$page{text}\n\n$string";

That's it.
